I had a horrible experience with Hotels.com. This is my personal view and opinion of Hotels. com. I booked a hotel/resort stay with them for my trip to PCB Florida in May. At that time of our trip, the Florida panhandle was preparing for tropical storm Alberto. After the state of Florida declared a State of Emergency, we decided to cancel our trip. We did not want to jeopardize our safety. I called to cancel my reservation. After explaining the situation, I was informed that the resort had been contacted during our phone conversation and that Hotels.com would process a refund on our reservation. I was led to believe that the situation had been taken care and was told to expect an email with information regarding my refund.
