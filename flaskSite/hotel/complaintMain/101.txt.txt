Our story is the same as below. Booked a ten day stay through Hotels.com. We received an email saying we paid in full and had a confirmed booking, we received another confirmation from the Four Seasons Hotel &amp; Resort as well as welcome letter. Also had conversations with Hotel managers who confirmed our reservation. And then received this email from Hotels.com cancelling our reservation or asking us to pay thousands of dollars more to secure our reservation.
