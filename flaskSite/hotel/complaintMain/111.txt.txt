I have used Hotels.com multiple times and was originally pleased with the results. Their hotel rewards offer is what really drew my husband and myself to continue to book through their website. This was, however, up until my most recent trip. Apparently I received $5 off my 4 night stay at a hotel in Paris, and as a result (not aware before) I lost out on adding those 4 nights to my already accumulating hotel nights. I called customer service after the trip and offered to pay the $5 (since $5 is clearly not equal to 4 nights) but they kept going back to their “terms and conditions” stating they couldn’t make it right for me (the customer). Additionally, it’s confusing because the coupon merely stated it couldn’t be combined with any other promotional offers which I did not believe included collecting their hotel nights. I will never use their site again and do not recommend them when there are many other options available.
