11 days after booking Hotels.com sent me an email asking for additional money to keep the booking or alternatively cancel reservation stating obvious mistake clause. I was puzzled and asked them what they mean by obvious mistake. It is an arbitrary term unless their contract describes what obvious mistake means. They replied with using additional part of contract that states they can cancel any booking anytime for any reason. So basically if you book through Hotels.com you are at their mercy. They expect customers to guarantee their end but there is zero guarantee and responsibility on Hotels.com's part even though my confirmation email reads guaranteed and paid for.
