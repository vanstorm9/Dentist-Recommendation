I cancelled a 2 night, 2 room reservation through Hotels.com. The rep I spoke with assured me that both rooms would be cancelled, but my credit card was charged for one room. I called Customer Service and provided the cancellation number. At first the person tried to pawn me off on the hotel, but I insisted this was Hotels.com's mistake.
