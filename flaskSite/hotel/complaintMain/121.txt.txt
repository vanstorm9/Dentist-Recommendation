Booked 2 rooms with Hotel.com. Arrived at hotel to find no rooms available. Told that Hotel.com consistently overbooks. Hotels.com would give no assistance in finding other rooms. They are now fighting Credit Card company to refund charges to my credit card. Use them to find hotel, then book directly with hotel so you get a room.
