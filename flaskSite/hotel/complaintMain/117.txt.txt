I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights at Ruby Hotel. Ruby Hotel (OTM11-8 Lotus Residences, Hoang Quoc Viet, Hung Thang Ward, Halong, Vietnam) through Hotels.com and used my debit card. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that they did not receive any confirmation from Hotels.com. Take note, that was 6 days prior to our arrival. We showed to them the confirmation email and the paid amount but they still did not acknowledge it. It was a stressful 9 hour trip just to arrive with no booked room! We were given an option to stay in the hotel but pay for 2 nights plus deposit and was asked to leave our passports! What the hell!
