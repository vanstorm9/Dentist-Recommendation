Worst customer service ever! Phone got disconnected once we confirmed the price match. After that no one calls back and managers refuse to help you. In fact, if you ask for a manager, they will consistently transfer you to another reservation agent. After another request, they will transfer you to a “manager” who has absolutely no authority to help you at all. The only thing they can do is make a reservation. If you have a complaint, they will hang up on you after they realize that you are not making a booking. This process happened over and over again on the same day. Do not use them!
