Hotels.com has always been a bit unreliable but now I see they are downright shady. I'm using their customer service for the first time...and wow. I was booking a hotel that I trust and have stayed at before (`$150) then I see a similar location slightly less quality hotel for $118...so I check it out and Hotels.com says there's 2 prices $139 and $118 the secret price (should have been a red flag but I don't distrust the site yet so...). I say, "Go ahead" and on the final screen after clicking purchase I see there's a fee tacked on making the room $139 (remember the normal price). No warning etc.
