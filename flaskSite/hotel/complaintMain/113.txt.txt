I booked and cancel a hotel in Toronto, Ontario through the Hotels.com near October 2018. They confirmed the total charged amount $0 before cancel. Also, it confirmed $0 after completing cancel process. But, I found the hotels.com partner took $650 later. Thus, I requested refund it from the hotels.com and its partner company. They refused because of their policy which was not mentioned on my confirmation data. There is non-refund statement policy on cancellation I already paid. However, it was $0 I paid. If I had known my paid amount was $650+, I would not cancelled. I couldn't sleep well for this. I need a lawyer but it lawyer fee will be bigger than refund. Please transfer this story to your friends via internet. I have screenshot and email with confirmation. I am wondering hotels.com is USA company? Or Canadian Company?
