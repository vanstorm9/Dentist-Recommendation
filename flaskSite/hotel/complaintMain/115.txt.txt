I don't recall making the reservation with Hotels.com. I never received a confirmation that I had a reservation at Castle Inn. They were not able to send me a correctly dated copy of the reservation. Somewhere between Hotels.com and Castle Inn things got screwed up. No refund was offered by Castle Inn.
