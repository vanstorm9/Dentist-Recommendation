Do not book using Hotels.com ever! I booked through them and the information was not clear on the APP. I travel for work and I know when at the time of making a reservation you have to pay in advance. Well, I was charged with $180 and something. I called and this lady (very rude) told me that is nothing they can do and I have to move forward. I requested to speak with the Manager and she told me that she need it some time to talk to the hotel and confirm their policies (which is understandable) and get back to me. Then the next day she sent this email confirming the refund and everything. I was very happy. This was Nov 19.
