Do NOT EVER book through Hotels.com. It is beyond misrepresented and shady! I booked a hotel room over a week in advance! I received several confirmations as well as confirmation number for my hotel. When I arrived to hotel at 12:30am they showed no reservation for me, the desk clerk typed in my confirmation number and it didn’t come up, he typed my name and nothing, he tried using my cell phone number and then my email address all epic fails!!!
