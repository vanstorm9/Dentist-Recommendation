We booked a family trip, with small kids, in Belgium in Belcasa Family Suites &amp; Lofts with Hotels.com. Arrived late, they sent us some email with instruction. When we arrived to the hotel location, opened the safe with provided password... Nothing! Empty. Called all possible phone numbers, no answer, no reply, and we had to stay in another hotel that night. It turns out that this shady hotel actually a real estate company and they keep their keys 4 km away in a small office of their another property. The email they sent us did not explain well this point, and was written in gibberish French. We asked for refund from the hotel, they refused and called us a liars. We asked Hotels.com to step in. They did nothing.
