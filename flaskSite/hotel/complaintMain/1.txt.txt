They have the worst customer service and they were so rude with me. I asked for a refund or a voucher of what I paid for the hotel because I couldn’t travel so I want to cancel my booking. Here is my story. I applied for an Indian visa but they did not give me the visa so it is out of my hand. I explained this to Hotels.com. They did not help me. The customer service only said "we’re sorry we cannot help you" and that’s it!!!
