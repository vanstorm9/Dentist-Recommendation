I would strongly advise anybody against using Hotels.com. Under their terms and conditions, they claim they are allowed to cancel any bookings that are listed at an incorrect price where there is an obvious error and informed me of this by email with regards to one of my bookings. I asked them where their definition on obvious errors were in the t's and c's as this was very subjective and not obvious to me. They ignored both of my emails and then proceeded to lie telling me they made numerous attempts at calling and emailing - I know this because the manager on the phone confirmed they received them.
