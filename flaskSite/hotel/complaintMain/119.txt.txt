We tried booking a reservation through Hotels.com, on their website under the "your booking" section, there was a prompt that stated the 'room is not available'. So we went ahead and booked a new reservation also using Hotels.com. Turns out, we were charged for both. We called customer service several times and hours later on the phone, they said they couldn't do anything. We are never using Hotels.com again. They take people's hard earn money and have no regard for customer service.
