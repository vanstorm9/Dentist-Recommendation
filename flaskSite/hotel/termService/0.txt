AGREEMENT BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND HOTELS.COM, LP
 
Welcome to the Hotels.com website (the "Website"). This Website is provided solely to assist customers in gathering travel information, determining the availability of travel-related goods and services, making legitimate reservations or otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes. The terms "we", "us", "our" and "Hotels.com" refer to Hotels.com, L.P., a Texas limited partnership and/or our subsidiaries. The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.
 
This Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Agreement"). By accessing or using this Website in any manner, you agree to be bound by the Agreement. Please read the Agreement carefully, as it contains important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. If you do not accept all of these terms and conditions, please do not use this Website. Be sure to return to this page periodically to review the most current version of the Agreement. We reserve the right at any time, at our sole discretion, to change or otherwise modify the Agreement without prior notice, and your continued access or use of this Website signifies your acceptance of the updated or modified Agreement.
 
USE OF THE WEBSITE
 
As a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that
 
1.  you are at least 18 years of age,
2.  you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation,
3.  you will use this Website in accordance with this Agreement,
4.  you will only use this Website to make legitimate reservations for you or for another person for whom you are legally authorized to act,
5.  all information supplied by you on this Website is true, accurate, current and complete, and
6.  if you have an Hotels.com account, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by anyone other than you. We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of this Agreement.
 
 
DISPUTES
 
Hotels.com is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns.  But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.
You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy (“Claims”) by contacting Hotels.com Customer Support at http://service.hotels.com/app/home/locale/en_US or on (877) 903-0071
If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.
Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify.  This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement).  This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted this Agreement regardless of whether prior versions of the Agreement required arbitration.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Agreement as a court would.
Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules.  The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section.  If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees, unless the arbitrator determines your Claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Expedia Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at Expedia, Inc., 333 108th Ave N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004.  If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided.  A party requesting arbitration must also provide a copy of the request to the AAA, at Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 or online at www.adr.org or at any AAA office. 
Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.  If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.  The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.  An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.

PREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONS
 
You acknowledge that Hotels.com pre-negotiates certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations on your behalf. The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre- negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by Hotels.com and the facilitation fee retained by Hotels.com to compensate us for our services. You authorize Hotels.com to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on Hotels.com’s services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by Hotels.com for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize Hotels.com to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.
 
You acknowledge that, except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, Hotels.com does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that Hotels.com pays to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room. The hotel suppliers invoice Hotels.com for tax amounts. The hotel suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Hotels.com does not act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by Hotels.com to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain our fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Our fees vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.
 
Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay. 
 
PAY NOW ONLINE OR PAY LATER AT HOTEL DETAILS
 
With certain hotels, you may be presented with the option to pay online immediately or to pay later at the hotel itself. If you select the option to pay online immediately, you will be charged the amount in the currency that you select immediately. If you select to pay later at the hotel itself, the hotel will charge you in the local currency of the relevant hotel at the time of your stay. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay. You shall provide the details of your payment card and the supplier or Hotels.com will often have to verify: (i) the validity of the payment card (through a charge of a nominal value that is either refunded within a few days or deducted from the final payment due to the supplier) and, (ii) the availability of funds on the payment card (to be confirmed by the bank issuing your credit card). Hotels.com reserves the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion (please see Supplier Rules and Restrictions).
 
Many bank and credit card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the merchant location (as defined by the card brand (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee are determined solely by the bank or other agency processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholders account. This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on this Website. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.

For specific restrictions on use of Coupons please see the relevant Coupon communication. 
Only one Coupon per booking may be used. Usual booking terms and conditions apply and all bookings are subject to availability. Coupons cannot be sold or transferred.

Hotels.com® Rewards Terms & Conditions
 
Hotels.com Rewards is a Hotels.com loyalty program (the “Program”). When you book and stay 10 nights with us, we give you 1 free night to redeem. This free night does not include taxes and fees (“Free Night”).
All bookings must be made online or with our call center. You can only collect nights or redeem Free Nights at an eligible Hotels.com Rewards property.
 
The Program is open to anyone over 18 years old who signs up to Hotels.com with a valid email address, and then joins the Program. Companies, associations, or other groups may not join. Employees of Expedia, Inc. will not be able to collect nights or redeem Free Nights if they make a booking through the B.E.S.T. program, or if they use an employee discount. If an Expedia, Inc. employee makes a booking without using their discount, they will be able to collect Hotels.com Rewards nights.
 
Collecting nights
 
You will collect 1 night for every night you stay at an eligible Hotels.com Rewards property. Collect 10 nights and we give you 1 Free Night. You must be signed in to your Hotels.com account when you book online so we can add the nights you collect to your account after your stay. If you make a booking with us by phone, you must tell us the email address on your account so we know where to add the nights. Only Hotels.com Rewards members collect nights. Other guests on the same booking do not, and you cannot collect nights for any hotel bookings you made before you joined the Program.
 
We will add any nights you collect to your account up to 72 hours after you check out of the Hotels.com Rewards property. If you collect nights but we later believe that you did not complete your hotel stay (an “Invalid Night”), we reserve the right to remove these Invalid Nights from your account. This could happen if you cancel your booking or did not turn up at the hotel, which would make the nights invalid. You cannot collect any Invalid Nights towards the 10 nights you need to redeem a Free Night.
 
You can check your account to see how many nights you have collected at any time. Just sign in at Hotels.com, or phone our call center. You are responsible for making sure your account is correct. If you believe that you have not collected the correct amount of nights, we will look into this for you. If any bookings are invalid as mentioned earlier, we will remove them from your account.
In addition to the information above, you will not collect nights for the following:
1. Bookings made with an affiliate Hotels.com site
2. Bookings made before you joined the Program
3. Package bookings i.e. hotel + flight
4. Some bookings made using a discount coupon, voucher or code – you will need to check the terms for each of these
5. Bookings made through Group Travel Services
6. Bookings that do not cost you anything, i.e. are free
 
Redeeming Free Nights
 
When you collect 10 nights, we will give you 1 Free Night to redeem at any eligible Hotels.com Rewards property. You can redeem your Free Night online, or give us a call and we will make your booking for you.
 
The maximum value of your Free Night is based on the value of the 10 nights you collected as long as they have not expired. This value is equal to the average daily rate, excluding taxes and fees, of the nights you previously stayed. If you collected a night at a Hotels.com Secret Price (defined below), this price rather than the regular price will be used for the purposes of the calculation. You must pay for taxes, fees, meals and any other costs associated with your Free Night.
If you used different currencies when collecting your 10 nights, the value of each night is currently calculated using the currency associated with the territory you were in when you joined the Program.
 
Free Night stays are subject to all applicable booking terms and conditions. You will not collect a night when you redeem your Free Night. Collected nights have no cash value, and you cannot redeem your Free Night for cash.
If you redeem your Free Night on a stay that is less than the maximum value of your Free Night, you will not get the difference in cash, credit or anything else. You can redeem your Free Night on a stay that costs more than the maximum value of your Free Night – you just pay the difference.
 
If you have more than 1 Free Night to redeem, you can choose which booking you want to apply it to. You cannot combine your Free Night with any other offer, discount coupon, voucher or code, unless the terms for each of these say you can. This means that when you book a stay and redeem your Free Night, you generally will not be able to get an additional discount on that booking.
If you redeem your Free Night on a booking that is longer than 1 night, we will automatically apply its value to the most expensive night in that booking, subject to its maximum value.
 
Free Night stays are subject to all applicable cancellation policies that are passed onto us by the Hotels.com Rewards property. If you cancel a Free Night within the property’s cancellation window, we will return it to your account within 72 hours of your cancellation. If you cancel a Free Night outside of the property’s cancellation window, it will not be returned to your account.
 
If you want to change the dates of a booking that includes the Free Night you redeemed, you will need to cancel the booking, wait for the Free Night to be returned to your account, then rebook so you can apply your Free Night to your new booking.
 
Hotels.com Rewards tiers
 
The Program has 3 tiers: Hotels.com Rewards, Hotels.com Rewards Silver and Hotels.com Rewards Gold. You will join as a Hotels.com Rewards member. When you collect 10-29 nights in a membership year, you will qualify for Hotels.com Rewards Silver. When you collect 30 nights or more in a membership year, you will qualify for Hotels.com Rewards Gold. A membership year runs for a year from the date you first created an account, and each anniversary after that.
Silver and Gold members have a dedicated phone number they can call 24/7 to make or discuss their bookings. And there are other benefits like early sale access and exclusive offers. These will all be available within 2 weeks of qualifying for Silver or Gold, and will last for the rest of that membership year and the whole of the following membership year. If you do not collect enough nights to stay in Silver or Gold, we will move you down a tier for the next membership year.
 
Changes and Termination
 
Your nights will not expire as long as you keep your account active at least once every 12 months. This means you must collect a night or redeem a Free Night in that time, and when you do, the expiry date will be extended for another 12 months. If you do not collect nights or redeem Free Nights in a 12 month period, your nights will expire and we may deactivate your account. If this happens, your nights will not be reissued. Sign into your account to check when your nights are due to expire.
We may change our terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice, including the rules for collecting nights, the different membership tiers and their qualification requirements and associated benefits, the rules for redeeming your Free Night, the list of eligible Hotels.com Rewards properties, and the maximum value of a Free Night. We may communicate these changes to you by email or on our Hotels.com website so please make sure you check your account regularly.
Hotels.com Rewards has no end date and will continue until we close it, which could happen at any time. If we do close the Program, you will have 30 days from when we announce its closure to redeem any Free Nights you have in your account. After that date, you will lose your Free Nights and you will not be compensated.
By continuing to collect nights and redeem Free Nights with Hotels.com Rewards, you accept any changes to these terms and conditions. You are responsible for keeping up to date on any changes that we may make. The most current version will always be available on our website.
 
General Hotels.com Rewards Terms & Conditions
 
We reserve the right to discontinue your membership if you act fraudulently or use our loyalty program in a way that does not comply with our terms and conditions, or any federal or state laws, regulations, statutes or ordinances.

Secret Prices are available on selected hotels and on selected dates only. Secret Prices will only be displayed where applicable to your hotel search.
Where a Secret Price is displayed next to a price which has been struck out (e.g. "£150 £100"), the price which has been struck out is the regular price for that hotel on Hotels.com with no other discount applied.
The "Prices" section of these terms and conditions will also apply to Secret Prices. Secret Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect bookings already accepted.
 
 
PRICE GUARANTEE TERMS
 
Price Guarantee - If you find a lower rate on Hotels.com or on another website by 23:59 local time the day before your stay, we will offer you the difference. Package reservations are not eligible for this guarantee, and other terms and conditions apply, as per the below.
 
Submitting a Claim - 
• For non-refundable bookings:  Hotels.com will compensate you by issuing a coupon with a value corresponding to the price difference. The coupon can be used on a future booking on the Hotels.com site. You must contact the customer call center or submit your request using the online Price Guarantee form by 23:59 local time the day before your stay. The room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives. 
• For refundable bookings: 
a) Where the cheaper rate is found on Hotels.com: You can either call the customer call center by 23:59 local time the day before your stay or cancel your existing booking online under Your Bookings when signed into your Hotels.com account and rebook online at the cheaper price. If you call us, the room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives. At your request, the customer service representative will rebook the room found at the lower rate using the payment details that you give on the phone. Your original booking will be cancelled by our customer service representative, and you will receive a refund for the price originally paid. Refunds will be processed by Hotels.com immediately, but your bank can take up to 30 days to process the refund.
b) Where the cheaper rate is found on a competitor’s site: Hotels.com will refund the price difference. You must contact the customer call center or submit your request using the online Price Guarantee form by 23:59 local time the day before your stay. The room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives. Refunds will be processed by Hotels.com upon verification of your request, but your bank can take up to 30 days to process the refund.
 
Comparison must be to same itinerary - The Price Guarantee is available only for exact itinerary matches, including property, room type, applicable cancellation policy, and dates of travel as booked through hotels.com. In addition, the comparison must be to the same property purchased stand-alone through another website.  In other words, properties booked on another website as part of a package will not be eligible for the Price Guarantee. The Price Guarantee applies to the cost of booked travel, as presented on your booking confirmation, including any taxes and fees collected by us from you at the time of booking. The Price Guarantee does not apply to any taxes or fees collected by any third party from you, such as those taxes and fees a hotel may collect directly from you when you stay at the hotel.  The Price Guarantee is not available for bookings on websites where the property or other booking details are unknown until after purchase. You must meet all requirements imposed on the lower price (if any), including, without limitation, residency, regional and age-related requirements.
 
Comparison must be available to the general public - The Price Guarantee applies only to prices both advertised and available to the general public. It also applies to our Secret Prices. The Price Guarantee does not apply to rates offered on competitors' membership program websites; corporate discounts or rates; group, charter, rewards program, incentive, meeting, convention, consolidator or interline prices; prices obtained via auction or similar process; or prices available only by using a coupon or other promotion not offered to the general public. The lower rate may not come from a website where you call to get the rate, or from an e-mail that you received. 
 
Claim Verification - All requests are subject to verification by hotels.com. We will not accept screenshots or other purported evidence of a lower price that we cannot independently confirm. Nor will we verify any request that we believe, in our sole discretion, is the result of a printing or other error or is made fraudulently or in bad faith. 
 
Refunds for Verified Requests (for refundable bookings only) - Verified refund requests will receive a credit to the card used for the reservation. Where you have paid for your hotel at the time of booking, we will send your refund upon verification of your request.  Where you have chosen to pay for your Hotels.com booking later at the hotel and you have found the cheaper price on another website, you must pay the hotel the original price upon arrival and we will send your refund after you have completed your stay.  Note, any refunds may take up to 30 days or the next billing cycle to appear on your statement.
 
Coupons (for non-refundable bookings only) - Coupons will be sent to you by email immediately after your request has been made and verified by Hotels.com. Coupon terms and conditions will apply (see above under ‘Conditions of use for discount codes’).
 
Changes - We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify or discontinue the Price Guarantee or to restrict its availability to any person, at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice or liability to you. The terms that are in effect at the time of your booking will determine your eligibility under the Price Guarantee. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms & Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
