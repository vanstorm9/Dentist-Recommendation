<p>Retro let me sign up at the gym but when I asked about canceling my membership I was referred to a phone number. At this number I was on hold over 30 mins and had to drop off to get back to work on two occasions. When I finally got through to someone they of course had to transfer me to a specialist whose only specialties seemed to be refusing to acknowledge my request, dragging the conversation on as long as possible, and trying to talk me into not canceling. In the end a change of my CC number was the only thing that stopped the charges. Retro Fitness is a terrible company to deal with. Join at your own risk.</p>
