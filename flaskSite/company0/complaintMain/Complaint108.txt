[<p>Just joined Retro Neptune City. Paid for a full year. Paid for 24 strength training sessions. After one session was unable to access computer program (after multiple attempts) to set up future sessions. Advised facility of difficulty. Advised by employee, "Nothing has changed since you signed up." After the one training session I was advised by the trainer that he "would text" to set up the next session. Never heard from him. </p>, <p>I was a member of Retro Fitness in Flemington NJ for 3 years. It was a good experience until I tried to cancel my membership. I was told that it takes 60 days (2 months) to process the cancellation, during which time I would continue to be charged. I could still use the gym during that time, though... My question is: Why is it that when you join Retro Fitness your paperwork is processed immediately, however, it takes 2 months when you cancel??? Planet Fitness processes your cancellation immediately. Poor business practice Retro Fitness! If you treat your customers fairly, they may return.</p>, <p>I enrolled at Retro Fitness with my husband and 15 yr old son, thinking it was a nice place since it had opened not long ago. The first day we went to the gym was very disappointing. There wasn't machines like at Planet Fitness, and I felt violated, perverts just eyeing you made it very uncomfortable. I told my husband and we decided it was not a place for us. My husband went to cancel and was told No unless you have a medical condition. I fully understand the policy however, if we decided not to go they can charge some early cancelation fee and not force us to keep a contract for a whole yr charging the card. </p>, <p>The whole home gym crap is ridiculous. If I'm able to use any facility I should be able to pay my dues at any facility instead of being sent to a different city or state to do so. All payments are handled by ABC financial anyway. There is no actual way to get any customer service complaint resolved... At the Belleville NJ Retro, the staff refused to get a manager or provide contact info to reach him myself. This gym in particular is the biggest offender. I've had more issues before even starting my work out than here than any other. Poor customer service, severe lack of knowledge, nasty attitudes, you name it they got it. Still waiting on several call backs day 11 and counting...</p>, <p>Retro Fitness makes you feel hijacked when you try to cancel your membership. I tried for months to cancel going into the gym, and was told to email. Emailed and was told to call. Called and was told the manager would get back to me but never did. Contacted corporate and was told to send documentation. Sent the documentation and was sent to collection. I will stick to the higher paying clubs who are concerned with keeping clients happy!</p>, <p>The Personal Trainer, Mark is a salesman. That was what I had forgotten, when I was approached by Mark to try out a free personal trainer session. Thus, Little G (12 year old minor child) and I sat at the personal trainer desk with Mark as he typed on his computer to formalize an agreement regarding said services.</p>, <p>I joined Retro Fitness in Edison, NJ October 2012, and have been a faithful member until I received a personal email from the owner of this franchise Mitchell Kurtzer. The content of his email was revolved around water usage, yes "water"!! This owner does not allow you to refill your water bottles after your run out, but instead wants you to refill a small cup if and when you become thirsty. What does my membership cover???</p>, <p>DO NOT JOIN THIS GYM!!! If I could give them ZERO stars, I would. JOHN, the "manager" is the worst manager I've ever dealt with in my entire life. CATHERINE, the general manager, should really think about who she's hired and consider getting rid of him as soon as possible. Seriously. After trying to cancel my membership for 4 months, I can say that this is the worst gym that I've ever dealt with in my entire life. </p>, <p>My wife and I signed up for a year membership and personal training for 6 months. We never signed up for auto renewal! We signed up. They asked if we thought we may continue with the PT after the 6 months and I said no! The person that signed us up must have took the paperwork after we were through and checked the auto renewal box and now they are taking $150 a month out of my account each month on top of two monthly membership fees! I told them I want my money back and they said they can't refund my money when I haven't even finished with my first 6 months of PT yet! This is scam and they get paid on commission so will change your paperwork after you leave and tell you you signed it months later! This is so wrong and be careful if you use this terrible gym!</p>, <p>I signed up 4 years ago and stopped going later in the year. They informed me I had to continue to pay for the rest of the year due to contract. And that after that it wouldn't be continued. It has been 4 years and they refuse to stop billing. Finally my bank blocked the charges and now they are putting me in collections and trying to ruin my credit. I haven't been to a Retro in just about 4 years and they still won't let me cancel. They are trying to tell me it's a lifetime membership. This is crazy and as a disabled veteran who is working like crazy to take care of my sick wife I am about to lose it. These people are messing with the wrong person.</p>, <p>I ran into financial difficulties and could no longer afford my gym membership, I was sent a bill in the mail for $200 and was told this is my remaining balance. When walking into the gym I was told it would only cost me $19.99 monthly and that's all, with no contracts to sign or commitments like other area gyms I was also considering to join. The rep then told me to sit at a computer to enter my personal information. After doing that and entering my debit card information, I was then being charged $21 and change monthly for my membership and I was very happy with that. </p>, <p>I joined Retro for more than a year and things happen. I moved to another state in May where gym is kind of far from me. I strongly believed there is no contract and cancel anytime. In May I was told to send them 60 days notice. I needed to travel all the way from my new place to them (because other Retro fitness have no access to my profile) to bring official letter. Then, they told me that it is not acceptable, that I should mail them only certified letter and not to the main office, to the local one.  Back and forth it took another month. Ok, they received it on June 18. Ok, it's fine. I made 2 more months payments (because it takes "60 days to cancel!" Reallyyy??). But when I was told that cancellation will not be done until I pay in August for the next year maintenance, it is unacceptable.</p>, <p>I had signed a one year lease. Instead of the membership automatically canceling, they have a policy where you will have to send in a certified letter 90 days before. Or else the membership keeps going and you will be billed for the rest of your life if you don't send in a certified mail. This gym is a good gym. But I somehow believe this law was written to scam people. If I have signed one year lease it should be a one year lease. It shouldn't be more than that. This is a disgusting rule that a gym can put on the books. It's amazing. If you have options please join other gyms. It took me almost an additional 6 months to cancel my membership. Please look into this.</p>, <p>I just want to place my review about Bayonne Retro Fitness because I don't agree about this membership date. I enrolled last year on November/2014, paid in advance 39.00 plus 21.34 - Bayonne Retro Fitness the grand opening was in January/2015. Now August/2015 my payment of 21.34 monthly was declined and I found out that I am in debt of 41.00 for annuity. So, what's that? My year calendar has 12 months and in my agreement doesn't say nothing about annuity fee - in 8 months says annual fee only. I would like to least receive an email telling me about this early payment, the explanation was all members have to pay in August. Doesn't look good! Always something hiding and fishy in this Retro.</p>, <p>Retro Fitness in East Windsor, NJ sucks!!! Canceled my account back in June and they stick me with a $40 yearly fee for August. Then they tell me that I can't reverse the payment due to the fact that I would be considered delinquent.. Really? WTF?!?!? So then I look up Retro Fitness on Consumer Affairs website... 88 complaints. Well, now you can add one more to that list you stinkin' **. I will be anxiously waiting to see your gym go bankrupt...</p>, <p>I have emailed Retro Fitness three times through the "customer support form" and just tried leaving a message at the corporate office but all mailboxes are full. I also tried emailing the corporate office with the email address provided and, of course, it bounced back. I need to cancel my membership and would like to know the procedure. From all the reviews I've read online, everyone that has followed the procedure are still being billed and hassled.</p>, <p>My daughter went with a friend�s brother under 17 years old back in January 2015 to check the gym out. The sales person that signed them up advised my daughter that I needed to come. I come in with a blank check and sign a minor waiver. I went in. I asked the sales person the information. He specially said to me �This is the deal. No membership fee for signing up that day ("This is the last day"). No money down. $19.99 starts Feb. for the next 12 months.� What about if I want to cancel - He said "just notify us 30 days prior and you will no longer be auto deducted and you�re done. No charges." I said great. I asked for a copy and he said it was all in the computer. Well of course I never saw it. Never received one nor received an email of one. </p>, <p>I have 6 girlfriends that all joined the Cortlandt Manor Retro Fitness and pay $20 a month including classes. I went to join today and Alfonso is telling me it's $30 a month. I really wanted to join this gym for convenience, price and because of all the good things I've heard but not if they change their prices at whim.</p>, <p>The owner pammy, he is more concerned with selling fake designer sunglasses, Nike, under armor than running a gym. I thought I was at a flea market!!! Lol. Pammy the owner of retro he is a charter! Pammy you really should focus on the gym. Trust me you don't need to supplement your gym's income with selling fake merchandise! Gym is very capable of making a profit, if you run it like a gym instead of a flea market!!!</p>, <p>I cancelled my membership with Retro Fitness in East Meadow on April 21, in person, per the owner, with a letter. The owner told me they have a 60 day cancellation policy (I thought most gyms were 30 days). So I was debited in May and June. I see the charge again on July 7. I called, owner said she would remove it, hasn't yet removed it. I contacted my bank and cancelled the debit card and I am still fighting with my bank to have the July charge removed. I would never go to that gym again.</p>, <p>You had an advertisement that you would waive your initiation fee or processing fee one or the other so I went and they told me that there was still a $25 fee. The people had earlier told me that it was $20� I said is there any way they could waive it. They said no. I asked to speak to the manager. They told me to come back. I went back twice to do so. Finally when I met Sam, my experience couldn't have been any worse.</p>, <p>I called couples months ago and told them that I want to cancel. Whoever answer the phone told me that it is better to continue until the year end (June). He told me that I didn't need to go to the fitness center to cancel my membership. I called today Friday and this woman told me that I have to go. She was nasty.</p>, <p>Personal training department dangers, they sign you up for five training intervals and the form actually switched in front of you. Way down somewhere it says a whole year then when you try to quit it cost you hundreds to bail out. You need certified letters and still they don't reply back.</p>, <p>I have signed my son up for a Retro Fitness membership in December 2014. I was told he could cancel if need be but am having problem doing it. Since I attempted to cancel my charges have gone from 19.99 to 39.49.. I called and have not been able to speak to manager Amy directly in reference to why such high charges. I questioned extra charge and was told it's a fee cause my bank had insufficient funds. I have overdraft protection and it would not reject a request for payment. I also wanna note on days payment was requested I had sufficient funds in my checking account. I think this is unfair charging and am looking to get a refund of overcharges. Thank you for your time and assistance.</p>, <p>The male manager at Retro Farmingdale treated me rudely. Was passive aggressive by snarling, ignoring, and turning his back on me. I yelled at him and appeared as the aggressor. Asked for his manager and was ignored again. Had to ask three times. Called Debra ** and was told the employee was sterling. Was humiliated and abused.</p>, <p>Watch Out! These SCAMS ARTISTS did two different contracts for me and my husband. When I cancel my contract without problems, but my husband who works and gets 70% outside the city can not cancel his contract. Hopefully, we froze the contract, returned it, explain his situation without no solution. There is no sense to be a member of a GYM without reside and stay only paying indefinitely. I cancel this blood sucks. Now they send our name to bad credit, after all attempts to amicable cancel this contract that we pay and never use.</p>, <p>Beware of this gym. They are all nice and friendly when you sign up. When you try to cancel they make you go through a process that is just ridiculous. They make you send them a certified letter asking to cancel and then they have the nerve to tell you that it takes 60 days to cancel. 60 days? The year is 2015 not 1945. They obviously have no regard for their customers' time. Also, try calling their headquarters at 732 431 0062. Nobody ever picks up the phone. Some people have full mailboxes and you cannot even leave a message. CROOKED and UNETHICAL jerks.</p>, <p>Went there on the 14th of May to check the gym facilities and got signed up to try Zumba class on the following Monday. Show up on Monday to benefit of the free class and the receptionist tells me my pass has expired. They have set it up to start on the 11th, which I was not ever there, and end it on the day I was supposed to start the class. It clearly was a mistake but the girl never even try to accommodate me with a good customer service. No alternative solution was provided but empty words. The trainer who could prove my story was on the phone for the longest time (also not really available on the day I visit the first time). I left. Definitely never will sign up for such a poor customer service fitness providers.</p>, <p>Please be wary if you join this gym. I joined the East Meadow, NY location. After 12 months, I cancelled my account in January. I was then told I had a free month and it would be cancelled after that. It's May and I'm still being charged. After calling to complain to the manager she states that there's a 60 day cancellation process, and that February and March don't count because they were free. First of all, I was told I only had one month free. Second, why wouldn't the free month count as part of the 60 days? Third, NO ONE told me about this 60 days BS when I signed up. I saw the awful reviews online and should have listened. I've now been unfairly sucked out of at least 40 dollars (and that's if I get a refund for May). I honestly try to be fair, but these are just awful business practices. I even have a Retro close to where I live now, but I'd rather drive further out than sign up there.</p>, <p>I entered into a contract for personal training with Profession Fitness who operates inside the Retro Fitness facility in Bordentown, however I cancelled that contract within the 72 hour window stated in the contract details. I have proof of the cancellation letter sent by certified mail with a return receipt. In the contract it states that if the contract is cancelled within the 72 hour allotted time frame, I am entitled to a full refund by the health club within 30 days. It has been more than 30 days and I have not received my refund. I have called the club on two occasions and the issue has not been resolved. I am owed a $599 refund.</p>]
