<p>My identity got stolen and I tried to have a civilized conversation with Charlie, the female owner of Retro Fitness, and she immediately began yelling that she doesn't care about my problem and I can simply pay what I owe to get out of the contract. I explained to her that that money was tied up due to fraud, but again, all she did was yell and constantly remind how she doesn't care about my problems and that I am "locked" in a contract and must pay or else she will send the collections after me. I asked twice for the corporate office and she hung up the phone. She hung up. Instead of talking, she resorted to childish behavior.</p>
