<p>My husband has been a member for over a year and I have been a member for a year. During that time, the gym has consistently gone downhill. They continue to give free memberships to new customers while treating the existing members like pond scum. The gym is getting ridiculously crowded and they never fix the equipment. The ladies' room is a mess. I have read other comments and it scares the hell out of me since it is obvious that you can't cancel your membership. The staff, with few exceptions, are con artists. Is there anything that can be done about this?</p>
