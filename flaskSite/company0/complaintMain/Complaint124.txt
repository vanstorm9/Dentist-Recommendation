<p>The staff Alexa and John and the owner are all crook, on paid membership they were so rude and arrogant. The owner is started to show his muscles and then misbehave when ask for membership rights. Machines not working, tv not working, bad very bad and worse attitude. Be careful while joining this gym, we still have to see how to get our refund while on the first day the behavior was so arrogant and nasty. We would advise all not to join this and be careful as you won't get anything for what you paid for.</p>
