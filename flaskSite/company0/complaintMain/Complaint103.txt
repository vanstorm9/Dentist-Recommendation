<p>Watch Out! These SCAMS ARTISTS did two different contracts for me and my husband. When I cancel my contract without problems, but my husband who works and gets 70% outside the city can not cancel his contract. Hopefully, we froze the contract, returned it, explain his situation without no solution. There is no sense to be a member of a GYM without reside and stay only paying indefinitely. I cancel this blood sucks. Now they send our name to bad credit, after all attempts to amicable cancel this contract that we pay and never use.</p>
