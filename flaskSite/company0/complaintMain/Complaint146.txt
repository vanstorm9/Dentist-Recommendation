<p>I went in for advice on personal training, asked for one month. However, received a 12-month package. I made three appts. Each time the trainer never ever showed. Tried to cancel; however, I was told by EFT that I had three days. That's it. The person running the program called me stating he will lower the price for me. That was two days ago; still no response. The gym is beautiful. People are friendly. The training personnel are horrible. I am so upset. Something needs to be done at once.</p>
