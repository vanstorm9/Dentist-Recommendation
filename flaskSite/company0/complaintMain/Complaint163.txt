<p>Worst gym I have EVER been to. Front desk was rude. 8 treadmills had OUT OF ORDER SIGN. I was told by another member the one I got on was broken and was waiting for a sign (and it was broken, I stayed 1 1/2 hours "trying" to get a good session in. When I left the treadmill still had no sign). Gym set up is tight and leaves no room to breathe. All the equipment is on top of the next. The bathroom was FILTHY. I could not find towelettes to wipe the equipment down (no one in the gym had the courtesy of wiping the equipment off after use I noticed). The weights were ALL over the floor and there were no handles on the machines to use the machines (I looked for 15 minutes for a handle, went to the desk to ask and was told they were "around" or being used. Not enough handles for the equipment they have?).</p>
