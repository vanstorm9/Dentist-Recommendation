<p>I signed up with EFT at Retro. The training program was inconsistent and the trainers never follow a program or weight guide. My chart was never accurate and was filled out randomly by a trainer for training he never performed!!! After a month or so of training, I started to Feel lower back pain that transform to radiation pain to my leg. I asked to stop my training till I get treatment. I was diagnosed with herniated disk in lower back and went trough extensive physical therapy and medication. To my surprise EFT claim its really not their problem since they are covered by my liability release. In addition they send their collection agency and placed derogatory claim on my credit report for $4550!!! Needless to say that the contract was not even half of this amount!!!! Yes I agree a class action need to be taken against them!!!!</p>
