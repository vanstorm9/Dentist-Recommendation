<p>Retro Fitness in Oceanside, NY is a scam! If I could give ZERO stars- I would!! First off- SCAM. My credit card numbers were in someone else�s account and after $336.89 in charges on someone�s else�s account, Retro Fitness and their third party account memberships management, ABC Financial DECLINED to issue me a refund and fix this error. I know that it was an error with their membership account services / set up and they refuse to resolve this and basically told me to, "**, we are keeping your $336.89." If that�s not horrible customer service, what is? </p>
