<p>I went to sign up and check out with a friend. Since I'm only in Manahawkin during the summer (couple of months), I only wanted a short term program. They told me sure a student program, but I was not sure of it. So I declined and told them so. But since they ran my credit card, they would send me a check, which they did (check # ** for $160.47, noted-3 day cancellation refund). But then, they kept charging my credit card monthly. I had my lawyer send a letter of my cancellation and refund (3 day refund). Then they charged me back the refund amount. </p>
