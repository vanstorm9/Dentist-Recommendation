<p>Retro Fitness representative of Route 440 in Jersey City, New Jersey is unprofessional and terribly lacking people skills and business acumen. First of all, Retro Fitness opened late after a continuous cry of opening soon. From the first day, they began to take email address and phone number boasting of $20 a month fee. Never once was I informed that there would be additional fees with the initial signing up. I agreed to pay whatever the cost. The problem began when I asked to have my billing date the first of the month. I also agreed to pay retro for the month of May with its eight remaining days. I am retired and get a check once a month on the 1st. In order to keep from having insufficient funds penalties, I asked humbly to begin on the 1st of the month. </p>
