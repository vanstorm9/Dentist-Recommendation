<p>I signed a contract for both a year of membership (Retro Fitness) and 6 months of PT. When I started to look at my bank statements, I saw they were not taking out the $19.99 they said was due but $40 each time. When I call and ask if someone is there that can help me, they set up a meeting and then the "manager" never shows up. I put a stop payment on my bank for them. But even before that, they sent me letters from their collection agency telling me I owe or they didn't have the right bank info, even though they were taking out double from my account the entire time. I paid my dues and just want to pay what I owe the next 6 months ($20 a month). I shouldn't have to fight. They take out double or keep charging me for the PT. I saw others� reviews and thought, �Well, that's out of state. Maybe mine wouldn't be like that since they make you feel taken cared of.� Bull! **. They are just out to ruin your credit and take your money and as long as I can pay them what I signed for, I'm fine. But until then, I will continue to tell my bank to not pay them at all no matter how much it hurts my credit.</p>
