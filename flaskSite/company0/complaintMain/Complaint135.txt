<p>I called to cancel my membership and they said that they needed a letter. So I said I would be right there. And that's when I was told it would take 2 months for it to be processed and that I would still have to pay and that it's in their contract that I signed. Why and how would one know 60 days in advance that they would need to cancel? Oh but you can't use the gym during those 2 months that it's being processed. Mmmm.</p>
