<p>There were two Retro Fitness locations that were convenient when I signed up at Retro 2 years ago, one near my home and one near work. Both locations are now closed. The one near my house closed on 24 December 2018. Now Retro will not let me cancel my automatic deduction from my credit card. I am told that I have to go to where I signed up... Duh the location that I signed up at IS NOW CLOSED. Just a bunch of crooks.</p>
