<p>Retro Fitness in Manahawkin, NJ is a horrible gym. The lack of management is ridiculous. I have been trying to cancel the membership since early February 2013. Here is my storyï¿½ In January of 2013, I moved to PA and spoke to a gym representative on the phone and I was told I had to cancel in person with new license. I drove almost four hours, handed my license to the guy behind deck. He took it, played with the computer, smiled, and said he canceled it. About a month later, I get a call from ABC Financial Services stating that my account was still open and I was overdue on my account. I had called the gym about 25 times to cancel and speak to the manager that is never ever there. </p>
