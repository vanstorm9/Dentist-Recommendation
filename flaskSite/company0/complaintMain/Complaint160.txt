<p>On 3/11, my mother and myself joined the Retro Fitness gym - 2571 Hempstead Tpke, East Meadow. After leaving, we both agreed we didn't like the atmosphere so we went to a different gym and joined there. The SAME night, we went back to Retro Fitness and told the SAME person who signed us up that we decided that gym wasn't for us. She ripped up our contracts and took our key chain scan passes. She told us that was it. I continued getting emails from them the days following so I called to make sure it was cancelled and was told "My sister and I run it. It was taken care of." </p>
