<p>My husband and I unfortunately signed a contract with Retro Fitness back in April. A month later, my husband lost his job. We went to our Retro location to explain the story of why we had to cancel and they outright said no! We were told when we signed the contract that canceling would not be an issue and now because we had no income and needed to cancel we are told no way. They said they would put our membership in a freeze status. Fast forward a few months later and now our contracts are with collections. We are being harassed by a collection agency with people who can barely speak English telling us we have to pay for the life of the contracts! This is harassment. Can you help? We are willing to pay for the three to four months do missed payments but not thousands of dollars that I don't have. This Deborah collector was beyond nasty, demanding money and not wanting to send anything in writing.</p>
