<p>My boyfriend has been trying to cancel his gym membership for longer than I care to recall. There is nothing you can do over the phone, except leave a message for someone to call you back. When they do, they tell you that you have to: Put your request in writing; Send the letter to them via certified mail; and Pay 2 months membership fee as a penalty. With that, we thought we would skip a step and go to the gym with the signed letter requesting to cancel. Would you believe that the manager refused to accept it??? It must be sent via certified mail...(Did I mention his contract was up 2 years ago?...)</p>
