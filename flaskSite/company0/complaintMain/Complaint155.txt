<p>I have been trying to cancel my membership with Retro Fitness in Middletown since September 2013. A friend of mine is a personal trainer and had given me a workout to do. I had asked one of the guys where a certain machine was. He was at the counter reading a newspaper as if he couldn't be bothered. Upon seeing my notebook with my workout, he began to drill me about where I got my workout, who my friend was, where she trained, he was so rude. I tried to cancel my membership and was told you had to cancel in Manahawkin because my membership had been transferred there. The Middletown manager tried to say I was close to $300 behind on payments. </p>
