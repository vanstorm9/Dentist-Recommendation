<p>They keep taking $350 out of my acct when I told Johnathan 2 months ago to cancel. They didn't cancel it, now I'm backed up in bills. I also have high blood pressure and I really wasn't supposed to be working with a trainer. I worked out twice only with a trainer and almost fell out after the workout. I called to speak to them and they are giving me the runaround. I can sue them, because they know I have high blood pressure. I stated it on the application. The worst.</p>
