[<p>Retro's are poorly managed and have very low standards. I would recommend not joining this gym unless you can tolerate a tacky atmosphere of loud obnoxious music, and members. Save your 20.00 and do something else to stay in shape.</p>, <p>Customer service is a very low (non existent) priority of **, the woman who owns this gym. Recently, over a period of many days some equipment was malfunctioning and staff didn't know when repairs would be made. For a number of days I asked that the owner please contact me. She never responded. On Sunday April 5th she was at the gym but avoided me. I asked why I never heard from her. Her response was if I'm dissatisfied she will cancel my membership; and that I should "get the hell out of there immediately; and that if I didn't she would call the police." I told her "yes, please cancel the membership and let me have a receipt confirming cancellation." Again, I was told to get the hell out of there or she would call the police. Any requests for information about this gym from others will definitely be met with "Do not join!"</p>, <p>I feel that Retro Fitness is not a fair company. I brought my son in who is 16 YRS, never seen a sign saying that if under 18 he could not come as a guest. However I have been noticing other people bring their child in who looks to be under than age of 11 and he works out all the time. I will say that I am not sure if he has a membership but no child can sign a contract so I question that situation. I am wondering how to get out of this contract because of some unfair things I have seen happen in the location I attend which is the one on McDade Blvd PA. I would like to go back to Planet Fitness where my child is allowed to come with me as a guest with no questions asked and where they treat everyone fair no matter what COLOR you are.</p>, <p>What would an 82 year old woman whose husband recently passed away really do to warrant being asked to leave after over 5 years a member... mention to management that she was going to let corporate know of the equipment not working and it not being fixed. With that one complaint she was asked to leave and had her membership refunded. When I tried to contact management as to why no warnings, I received no response. Corporate heads should follow up to ensure that the local independently owned gyms are being held to the corporate standard that was originally set when the company was opened. I am very disappointed.</p>, <p>Overall, as a customer I am satisfied with every aspect of the gym. My only issue is I have a schedule every morning. I wake up at 430am to be there by 5am to get an hour's work out daily and every morning the employees no less than 5 to 10 minutes late. For instance today 3/16/2015 he/she is 30 minutes late which is unacceptable. So I left and could not work out and my scheduled work out was ruined.</p>, <p>Me and my fiance had this gym for about a year. We were moving to fl so we called to see how we cancel. Told us have to be certified letter, 30 days cancel notice. We did exactly that and guess what, now there is a 132$ acct from them in collections on my credit.</p>, <p>My husband has been a member for over a year and I have been a member for a year. During that time, the gym has consistently gone downhill. They continue to give free memberships to new customers while treating the existing members like pond scum. The gym is getting ridiculously crowded and they never fix the equipment. The ladies' room is a mess. I have read other comments and it scares the hell out of me since it is obvious that you can't cancel your membership. The staff, with few exceptions, are con artists. Is there anything that can be done about this?</p>, <p>My credit card is on file with Retro Fitness because they take our monthly gym dues out which I gave them permission by signing their contract. After being members for close to 3 years my son was approached by one of the personal trainers about this supposedly great deal where he would have a personal trainer and it would only cost about 30$ a month and he could cancel anytime. So my son, even though he was 21 at the time was very gullible and trusting so he signed the contract. When he came home and told me about it I told him to go back and cancel it. </p>, <p>Received an advertisement from Retro Fitness, 11 Park Place, Paramus, New Jersey, advertising two choices of membership: 1. A year membership with $0 enrollment paying a processing fee of $21.39 and recurring monthly charge of 21.39 (with tax included) OR 2. A no contract membership paying $53.49 up front and recurring $21.39 per month (with tax included) with the stipulation you can drop out whenever you would like, but you lose the $53.49. The advertisement DOES NOT mention the charge of a fee of $41.73 in August for BOTH of these plans. If you visit the gym to sign up, you will not be told; if you sign up online, it is not apparent. YOU MUST READ THE TERMS CAREFULLY as I did before joining.</p>, <p>I just complained to BBB. I have also complained with all the Retro Fitness managers (Anthony, Adam, Betsy), and Retro Fitness Corporate (John Michael from customer services) with no effect. The gym is clean but avoid their personal training services. If you have problems with it, they won't help you resolve it. Once you sign a 12 month contract you are stuck. They have lied to me, not honored their word, provided the worst customer service I have ever experienced and implied I am lying. They have been unprofessional by not keeping scheduled appointments.</p>, <p>I signed up for the gym before it opened. At that time they told me all classes were think we did. Now they want to charge me for all classes. Bad service. They don't fix the equipment. They don't have a separate area for exercise. And I cannot get in touch with corporate office.</p>, <p>My boyfriend has been trying to cancel his gym membership for longer than I care to recall. There is nothing you can do over the phone, except leave a message for someone to call you back. When they do, they tell you that you have to: Put your request in writing; Send the letter to them via certified mail; and Pay 2 months membership fee as a penalty. With that, we thought we would skip a step and go to the gym with the signed letter requesting to cancel. Would you believe that the manager refused to accept it??? It must be sent via certified mail...(Did I mention his contract was up 2 years ago?...)</p>, <p>I joined the club on 1/27/15 but I was waiting for a job that I applied. The job came through on Wednesday 1/29/15 just 2 days after joining. I told them my job is 2 hours away from my home state, and I have the need to stay here and visit my state only on weekends. I need that time to spend with my kids. I try to cancel the contract but nobody help me. Also at front nobody tell you that you will be charge 40 dollars after 6 months using the gym, beside the 20 dollars of monthly fee. They are fake. I hope that all of them end up in jail.</p>, <p>I walked into Retro Fitness in Neptune NJ with my sister-in-law. A girl at the counter told me that she would help me with a 7-day trial period with no membership needed, that she would need two forms of ID and to pay for the trial. I paid for the trial on the account that the attendant behind the counter stated that Retro would not take money out of my account without my consent. </p>, <p>After not using the gym for many months, I visited their Commack facility on May 5th 2014 to cancel. I was leaving for Europe for 6 weeks and decide to cancel my membership after being a member for about a three years. I was told that here would be a two month penalty according to their agreement which agreed to and that they will bill me for an additional two month. I walked away and was never asked to sign or do anything more. After I returned from EU I noticed that they were still taking money from my account. I then visited the Dear Park facility and asked why I was still getting charged and was told that I would have to discuss this with the Commack facility since all my records were supposedly there. </p>, <p>The staff Alexa and John and the owner are all crook, on paid membership they were so rude and arrogant. The owner is started to show his muscles and then misbehave when ask for membership rights. Machines not working, tv not working, bad very bad and worse attitude. Be careful while joining this gym, we still have to see how to get our refund while on the first day the behavior was so arrogant and nasty. We would advise all not to join this and be careful as you won't get anything for what you paid for.</p>, <p>I originally signed up at a brand new Retro Fitness in Forked River, NJ. I signed up so I could get free classes for a year, it was a promotion. The building was still not ready but they had a little office set up. I just moved back to NJ from OR where I didn't have such problems as I do in NJ (NJ is a joke, don't live there if you don't have to). Anyway, I had to transfer my membership to Toms River on rt 37. I never took any classes at the Lacey Retro because they were not open yet, but I had a situation where I had to move kinda fast. So, Toms River and Lacey tell me in order to transfer my membership I have to check in 13 days out of the month. I checked it day after day after day after day and I would ask occasionally, "Did my membership change over?" "Not yet, not yet, not yet." </p>, <p>My two sons (22 &amp; 16 y/o) signed up and paid upfront (they thought that what they paid was for the annual dues, but wasn't), it was just for the membership! They found out later that they need to pay every month for the monthly dues! Told them right away that they need to cancel that because they don't have money for that and just went for two months (July &amp; August, summer '13) and haven't got back because they got back to school! The bills kept coming and I even called them. They said my sons need to go there personally to cancel it! But when they went there they just showed them that they electronically signed-up for it and need to stay for one year and pay for the dues! My son who was 16 (whose a minor) even I told him that I'm not paying for it, settled the account but my other son just requested to hold his membership because he can't afford it! Now, there's this collection agency calling him everyday about this matter! </p>, <p>I canceled my account in December 2013. They told me I had to do this in writing which I did and dropped off in person. They then told me I was liable for the contract until August of 2014. What happened to being able to cancel at any time. Now I receive in the mail a payment booklet showing I owe through August of 2015. I called again and spoke to the rudest girl (Amanda) who is a manager at this site. She informs me they do not have a written cancellation on file. I also explained if she looks at my attendance records I have never even been there because I canceled. They apparently give false information on cancellation at any time. Do not keep good records, and are extremely rude. Don't become a member of Retro. They are terrible.</p>, <p>I never got any assistance. When I asked for help they said I needed an appointment. I made 2 appointments. One man was on the phone for half an hour. I left. The other never showed for work. I had no idea what to use.. I'm 79 yrs old. The bikes were hard to get on. Some machines didn't work. I had to ask other people what they were doing and why. I tried my best but often went home hurting... They told me I couldn't cancel unless I moved over 25 miles away or had a doctor's note. My doctor wrote a note but I haven't heard from them.</p>, <p>Dirty. They sent the contract by email after we had paid and signed through electronics. They did not tell us there is a hefty cancellation fee. We would not have joined. Below, they stipulated that THAT THEIR CLIENTS CANNOT CANCEL. (Is that legal?). "You understand that, except as herein provided, your membership is absolutely non-cancellable..."</p>, <p>My husband and I unfortunately signed a contract with Retro Fitness back in April. A month later, my husband lost his job. We went to our Retro location to explain the story of why we had to cancel and they outright said no! We were told when we signed the contract that canceling would not be an issue and now because we had no income and needed to cancel we are told no way. They said they would put our membership in a freeze status. Fast forward a few months later and now our contracts are with collections. We are being harassed by a collection agency with people who can barely speak English telling us we have to pay for the life of the contracts! This is harassment. Can you help? We are willing to pay for the three to four months do missed payments but not thousands of dollars that I don't have. This Deborah collector was beyond nasty, demanding money and not wanting to send anything in writing.</p>, <p>Deer park - Employees are good but the owner could care less about the gym. The equipment is old and not maintained, the rubber grips are never replaced on any of it. The water fountain barely works and slowly spills out warm water, it's been that way for two years, the bathroom sinks don't work.. The place is a mess.</p>, <p>They keep taking $350 out of my acct when I told Johnathan 2 months ago to cancel. They didn't cancel it, now I'm backed up in bills. I also have high blood pressure and I really wasn't supposed to be working with a trainer. I worked out twice only with a trainer and almost fell out after the workout. I called to speak to them and they are giving me the runaround. I can sue them, because they know I have high blood pressure. I stated it on the application. The worst.</p>, <p>I cancelled my son's account on May 13, 2014. They told me I need to pay for the next two months so I transferred his account to my name. At the end of July, I should have been done. So I thought, and on August 1, 2014 they charge me $29.00 for an annual fee and I call and the response I got was that everyone gets charged. Well that's fine if everyone did not cancel. She told me I need to call the billing company and discuss it with them. I informed her that's not my job and I don't get paid to do her job. I left a message for a manager to call back, but because it was a weekend, apparently they have no managers on until Monday. I waited and did not receive a call back. </p>, <p>Have called countless times and I haven't been able to cancel my contract after which I refuse to pay anymore and put a stop on my bank account. Now they are calling me because I owe them money. This Gym is Horrible and the way the staff treats you is unbelievable.</p>, <p>I called to cancel my membership and they said that they needed a letter. So I said I would be right there. And that's when I was told it would take 2 months for it to be processed and that I would still have to pay and that it's in their contract that I signed. Why and how would one know 60 days in advance that they would need to cancel? Oh but you can't use the gym during those 2 months that it's being processed. Mmmm.</p>, <p>I've been trying to cancel my membership. I've called numerous times at one point they told me I needed to wait til the manager was in, so callback. I called back and then I was told to come in to cancel and then when I finally go to cancel they tell me I need to send a certified letter to them. And the manager had to have been all of 18 years old and didn't know much about anything. They are complete scam artists and the girl just kept telling me I signed a contract. I was in this contract for well over a year and now I wasn't out. This needs to be investigated and something needs to be done, I see I'm not the only one with this problem.</p>, <p>What a fraud. I am trying to cancel my contract. No one ever said you couldn't cancel and give 30 days notice. They make it impossible to get out. Don't sign anything!!!</p>, <p>The gym facility is horrible. It's too crowded. The stretching space has boxing equipment in the same area so when you're over there, you're likely gonna encounter somebody banging on the boxing equipment which is really, really loud. The General Manager has the worst attitude, which I found out wasn't unique to me. I asked some of the other members and they all had the same experience.</p>]
