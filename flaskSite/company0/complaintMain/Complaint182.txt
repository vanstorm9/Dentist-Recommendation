<p>People like the owner/manager Michael Padula are tools. Let me define tool. A tool is an apparatus or a (person) to get something done. To some, the word tool may have a much stronger derogatory meaning, but to me, it's an oversimplified sort of person. My contract with Retro Fitness was terminated because Padula got complaints from his staff and clients. I was not notified that I had such a caustic effect on some of the folks in the space. Padula is a tool, and tools like Padula think very 2 dimensionally. There is no reason why a gym should be run by a tool. I am the gregarious/friendly sort. One very unique trait is I am bluntly honest. Most people cannot handle my level of complete transparency. Padula, members of his staff, and some clients are just too narrow-minded and ignorant to enjoy their surroundings, and the people around them. Live, love, enjoy!</p>
