<p>For the price of the gym membership it's worth it. I specify 'gym' because they will try to convince you to sign up for personal training once you become a member and when you ask questions such as "Is this a monthly cost or am I only paying for eight sessions to try out the trainer without any obligation" and the manager says, "that's right you're only signing up for eight sessions and you're not bound to a contract." We just want you to sign this pad that allows us to use the same credit card on file. BEWARE! They lie to get you to sign a pad that doesn't state anything of the sort and when you find out after the fact, the eight sessions you initially thought you signed up for is really a down payment for a twelve month contract totaling $1,755.60. I asked for a refund and they pass it off to the next guy on duty. They still have not resolved the issue and it's been over two months now. Very disappointed.</p>
