<p>Trying to cancel membership - I sent a registered letter, cancelling my policy mid-April 2012. I received a charge on my credit card end of April. I figured okay, just the residue. I got another charge end of May. I disputed bills for April and May. I received a letter from a collection agency stating I owe. I replied with the registered letter receipt number. They ignored the letter and sent another. I told my credit card company to not allow any more bills and they agreed. I just received a phone call from ABC Financial Services, saying it was urgent I respond. I did not. I did send another letter to the collection agency. We'll see how far this goes.</p>
