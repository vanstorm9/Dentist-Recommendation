<p>I entered into a contract for personal training with Profession Fitness who operates inside the Retro Fitness facility in Bordentown, however I cancelled that contract within the 72 hour window stated in the contract details. I have proof of the cancellation letter sent by certified mail with a return receipt. In the contract it states that if the contract is cancelled within the 72 hour allotted time frame, I am entitled to a full refund by the health club within 30 days. It has been more than 30 days and I have not received my refund. I have called the club on two occasions and the issue has not been resolved. I am owed a $599 refund.</p>
