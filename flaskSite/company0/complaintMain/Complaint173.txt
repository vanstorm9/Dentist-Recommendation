<p>I have been a member for years and have recently found the conditions at this Howell Retro to be deplorable. This Saturday morning, there was toilet paper on the floor in the women's bathroom and it hadn't been cleaned. I also take offense to their sending me emails to advertise their other business venture, 21 South Bar and Grille. Not a particularly good connection to the health and fitness model they project.</p>
