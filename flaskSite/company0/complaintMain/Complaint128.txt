<p>I never got any assistance. When I asked for help they said I needed an appointment. I made 2 appointments. One man was on the phone for half an hour. I left. The other never showed for work. I had no idea what to use.. I'm 79 yrs old. The bikes were hard to get on. Some machines didn't work. I had to ask other people what they were doing and why. I tried my best but often went home hurting... They told me I couldn't cancel unless I moved over 25 miles away or had a doctor's note. My doctor wrote a note but I haven't heard from them.</p>
