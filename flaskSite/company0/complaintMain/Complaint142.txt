<p>My daughter joined Retro Fitness and we signed up for a personal trainer just so she knows what to do and how to do it correctly. We only wanted the personal trainer for 2 months, and now they are taking $210.00 out of my bank acct every month, plus $40.00 for her monthly membership fees which are only supposed to be $20.00 a month. We wrote a letter expressing we no longer need the personal trainer and she is going to give up her membership and that was 4 months ago. I am furious with these people. I call and they tell me it is a automatic renewal and I explained everything to the person on the phone we don't want the membership anymore, but come the following month, they do it again - take my money. THEY ARE RIP OFF ARTISTS.</p>
