<p>I feel that Retro Fitness is not a fair company. I brought my son in who is 16 YRS, never seen a sign saying that if under 18 he could not come as a guest. However I have been noticing other people bring their child in who looks to be under than age of 11 and he works out all the time. I will say that I am not sure if he has a membership but no child can sign a contract so I question that situation. I am wondering how to get out of this contract because of some unfair things I have seen happen in the location I attend which is the one on McDade Blvd PA. I would like to go back to Planet Fitness where my child is allowed to come with me as a guest with no questions asked and where they treat everyone fair no matter what COLOR you are.</p>
