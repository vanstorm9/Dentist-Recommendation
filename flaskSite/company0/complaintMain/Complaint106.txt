<p>Please be wary if you join this gym. I joined the East Meadow, NY location. After 12 months, I cancelled my account in January. I was then told I had a free month and it would be cancelled after that. It's May and I'm still being charged. After calling to complain to the manager she states that there's a 60 day cancellation process, and that February and March don't count because they were free. First of all, I was told I only had one month free. Second, why wouldn't the free month count as part of the 60 days? Third, NO ONE told me about this 60 days BS when I signed up. I saw the awful reviews online and should have listened. I've now been unfairly sucked out of at least 40 dollars (and that's if I get a refund for May). I honestly try to be fair, but these are just awful business practices. I even have a Retro close to where I live now, but I'd rather drive further out than sign up there.</p>
