<p>Two sons joined well over a year ago, almost two years now. One son moved. He called to cancel, still being charged on his credit card. Sent a certified letter to East Meadow and home office in NJ to demand cancellation. Other son, being charged $29.00 and $19.99 for the month of August! Called them in East Meadow, they said have to come in person. What the hell?? Never heard of such crap in my life! Want the memberships cancelled! What a waste of $! Never would recommend this place EVER!</p>
