<p>I had signed a 1-year contract with Retro Fitness in Deer Park, NY. My final payment under that contract was supposed to be January 19, 2014. I purposely DID NOT elect for auto renewal because of the complicated terms to cancel it. I left that part not initialed. I come to find out I had been charged for February, March, and now April. I went in to see what the deal was and they showed me a scanned image of my contract with the auto renewal initialed. My copy clearly shows it was left blank. Someone initialed it after I left!!!</p>
