<p>After not using the gym for many months, I visited their Commack facility on May 5th 2014 to cancel. I was leaving for Europe for 6 weeks and decide to cancel my membership after being a member for about a three years. I was told that here would be a two month penalty according to their agreement which agreed to and that they will bill me for an additional two month. I walked away and was never asked to sign or do anything more. After I returned from EU I noticed that they were still taking money from my account. I then visited the Dear Park facility and asked why I was still getting charged and was told that I would have to discuss this with the Commack facility since all my records were supposedly there. </p>
