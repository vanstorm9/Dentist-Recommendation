<p>Overall, as a customer I am satisfied with every aspect of the gym. My only issue is I have a schedule every morning. I wake up at 430am to be there by 5am to get an hour's work out daily and every morning the employees no less than 5 to 10 minutes late. For instance today 3/16/2015 he/she is 30 minutes late which is unacceptable. So I left and could not work out and my scheduled work out was ruined.</p>
