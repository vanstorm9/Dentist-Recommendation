<p>I have been dealing with trying to cancel my membership since 9/21/13 but the owner never cancelled the membership. Worst yet, she never returned my phone calls until mid December. I went in person to resolve this issue, the owner Christina told me I still owed money. I asked her to explain why it took her three months to return my 5 phone calls. "You should have read your contract," it sounded like speaking to a robot. She is not listening, I have never heard of a ridiculous policy like this. I always paid my dues a month ahead, and she purposely didn't cancel the membership to squeeze more money out of me. </p>
