<p>Beware of this gym. They are all nice and friendly when you sign up. When you try to cancel they make you go through a process that is just ridiculous. They make you send them a certified letter asking to cancel and then they have the nerve to tell you that it takes 60 days to cancel. 60 days? The year is 2015 not 1945. They obviously have no regard for their customers' time. Also, try calling their headquarters at 732 431 0062. Nobody ever picks up the phone. Some people have full mailboxes and you cannot even leave a message. CROOKED and UNETHICAL jerks.</p>
