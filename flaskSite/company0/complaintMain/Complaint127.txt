<p>I canceled my account in December 2013. They told me I had to do this in writing which I did and dropped off in person. They then told me I was liable for the contract until August of 2014. What happened to being able to cancel at any time. Now I receive in the mail a payment booklet showing I owe through August of 2015. I called again and spoke to the rudest girl (Amanda) who is a manager at this site. She informs me they do not have a written cancellation on file. I also explained if she looks at my attendance records I have never even been there because I canceled. They apparently give false information on cancellation at any time. Do not keep good records, and are extremely rude. Don't become a member of Retro. They are terrible.</p>
