<p>This gym is a master at this particular scam. When you try to cancel, they will IGNORE the letter or whatever way you cancelled. You will still continue to get billed. They will send you to collections. And they are INSANELY RUDE on the phone. I am still trying to get out of a membership. I canceled 5 MONTHS AGO!!!!</p>
