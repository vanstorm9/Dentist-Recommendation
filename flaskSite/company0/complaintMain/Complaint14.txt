<p>On November 28, 2007, my 17 year old daughter entered a one year agreement with this gym. She had her monthly amount of 21.39 deducted from her checking account. On September 4, 2008, we sent a letter requesting that her membership be discontinued due to her attendance at college. We sent the letter certified mail, return receipt requested, as required on the contract. However, the letter came back to us stating there is no such address. We double-checked the address on the contract and it was clearly sent to the right address. </p>
