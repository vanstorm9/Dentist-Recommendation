<p>I was offered and signed on for a comprehensive personal training program that included my past, present and future fitness goals, strength and endurance training and a diet program for weight loss. Upon my second visit I was informed that I would not be given a diet plan as they were not dietitians. I had informed the trainer that I had a low back and shoulder injury; however he continuously instructed me to perform exercises and/or lift weights too heavy for my fitness level. I received no endurance program, and when asked was told that I looked like I knew what I was doing. </p>
