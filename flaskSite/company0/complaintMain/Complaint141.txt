<p>I met with the fitness manager Tyrees to inquire about personal training sessions. At that time I was interested in obtaining personal training sessions for a month or two to kick start my plan to lose weight and get in shape. The fitness manager, Tyrees, spent about 40 minutes convincing me that if I sign up for a year program and pay the full amount of money cash in advance I will have a full comprehensive program. The full comprehensive program according to Tyrees will include: 1) a monthly progress evaluation with him personally 2) bimonthly body measurements 3) Diet evaluation and advice by my personal trainer 4) a monthly meeting with certified dietitian 5) a customized workout adjusted to my progress and ability.</p>
