<p>I've been trying to cancel my membership. I've called numerous times at one point they told me I needed to wait til the manager was in, so callback. I called back and then I was told to come in to cancel and then when I finally go to cancel they tell me I need to send a certified letter to them. And the manager had to have been all of 18 years old and didn't know much about anything. They are complete scam artists and the girl just kept telling me I signed a contract. I was in this contract for well over a year and now I wasn't out. This needs to be investigated and something needs to be done, I see I'm not the only one with this problem.</p>
