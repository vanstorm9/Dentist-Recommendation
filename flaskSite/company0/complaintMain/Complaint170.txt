[<p>For the price of the gym membership it's worth it. I specify 'gym' because they will try to convince you to sign up for personal training once you become a member and when you ask questions such as "Is this a monthly cost or am I only paying for eight sessions to try out the trainer without any obligation" and the manager says, "that's right you're only signing up for eight sessions and you're not bound to a contract." We just want you to sign this pad that allows us to use the same credit card on file. BEWARE! They lie to get you to sign a pad that doesn't state anything of the sort and when you find out after the fact, the eight sessions you initially thought you signed up for is really a down payment for a twelve month contract totaling $1,755.60. I asked for a refund and they pass it off to the next guy on duty. They still have not resolved the issue and it's been over two months now. Very disappointed.</p>, <p>I met with the fitness manager Tyrees to inquire about personal training sessions. At that time I was interested in obtaining personal training sessions for a month or two to kick start my plan to lose weight and get in shape. The fitness manager, Tyrees, spent about 40 minutes convincing me that if I sign up for a year program and pay the full amount of money cash in advance I will have a full comprehensive program. The full comprehensive program according to Tyrees will include: 1) a monthly progress evaluation with him personally 2) bimonthly body measurements 3) Diet evaluation and advice by my personal trainer 4) a monthly meeting with certified dietitian 5) a customized workout adjusted to my progress and ability.</p>, <p>My daughter joined Retro Fitness and we signed up for a personal trainer just so she knows what to do and how to do it correctly. We only wanted the personal trainer for 2 months, and now they are taking $210.00 out of my bank acct every month, plus $40.00 for her monthly membership fees which are only supposed to be $20.00 a month. We wrote a letter expressing we no longer need the personal trainer and she is going to give up her membership and that was 4 months ago. I am furious with these people. I call and they tell me it is a automatic renewal and I explained everything to the person on the phone we don't want the membership anymore, but come the following month, they do it again - take my money. THEY ARE RIP OFF ARTISTS.</p>, <p>I signed up with EFT at Retro. The training program was inconsistent and the trainers never follow a program or weight guide. My chart was never accurate and was filled out randomly by a trainer for training he never performed!!! After a month or so of training, I started to Feel lower back pain that transform to radiation pain to my leg. I asked to stop my training till I get treatment. I was diagnosed with herniated disk in lower back and went trough extensive physical therapy and medication. To my surprise EFT claim its really not their problem since they are covered by my liability release. In addition they send their collection agency and placed derogatory claim on my credit report for $4550!!! Needless to say that the contract was not even half of this amount!!!! Yes I agree a class action need to be taken against them!!!!</p>, <p>This gym is a master at this particular scam. When you try to cancel, they will IGNORE the letter or whatever way you cancelled. You will still continue to get billed. They will send you to collections. And they are INSANELY RUDE on the phone. I am still trying to get out of a membership. I canceled 5 MONTHS AGO!!!!</p>, <p>I had signed a 1-year contract with Retro Fitness in Deer Park, NY. My final payment under that contract was supposed to be January 19, 2014. I purposely DID NOT elect for auto renewal because of the complicated terms to cancel it. I left that part not initialed. I come to find out I had been charged for February, March, and now April. I went in to see what the deal was and they showed me a scanned image of my contract with the auto renewal initialed. My copy clearly shows it was left blank. Someone initialed it after I left!!!</p>, <p>I went in for advice on personal training, asked for one month. However, received a 12-month package. I made three appts. Each time the trainer never ever showed. Tried to cancel; however, I was told by EFT that I had three days. That's it. The person running the program called me stating he will lower the price for me. That was two days ago; still no response. The gym is beautiful. People are friendly. The training personnel are horrible. I am so upset. Something needs to be done at once.</p>, <p>Was charged an enrollment processing and maintenance fee (totaling almost $54.00) and was not told all this.</p>, <p>My situation is similar to other complaints that I've read. I cancelled my membership because of medical issues but I did complete my year membership so that I was not charged the penalty for cancelling early. I had fully planned on going back once my arm and shoulder were healed but in the meantime, my wallet was stolen with all of my credit cards in it so I cancelled my cards. Because they could not charge my card, I am being harassed by the company that bills for them. I had already met my year commitment so I do not understand why they didn't just cancel when I requested. I called the NE Philadelphia location and was instructed to email **, the General Manager, and he would take care of it. I have not had one response from **. In my email, I told them the card that they would try to charge was not valid and explained the situation. I will never go back now and will try to warn everyone that will listen what a ripoff this company is!! Go to LA Fitness. It costs more but is well worth it!</p>, <p>I signed up to Retro Fitness a few years back, in the beginning I was going quite regularly, after a while I stopped going, but I didn't plan on canceling my membership as I was planning to start going again, then for some reason there was a problem with my credit card and the charge did not go through (that was well after a year of membership) so instead of canceling my membership, they continue to try charge my card and add a penalty charge, and then send it to collection. I think this is a total ripoff strategy by Retro Fitness, that's totally unheard of, every other company with such kind membership would just simple cancel your membership. I think a CLASS ACTION needs to be filed against them.</p>, <p>This company is just a spam, they're not here to provide you service so are here to steal your money and to fool you in their contract. In tiny small letters you agree to auto renew your membership for a year unless you send a certified letter 90 days before your membership ends.</p>, <p>I joined Retro Fitness in Easton, PA in July of 2011 and made my first attempt to cancel the membership in July 2012. I specifically waited until that time because of the one year commitment, not mentioned by the person at the gym, but hidden in the contract. I did this by calling the 800 number I was given at the local gym. Debits of my bank account continued and I called again in August of 2012. Still debits continued so I went to the location in person but again was told to call the 800 number. This time, late August, I sent written request to the only address I could find, that of the local gym.</p>, <p>I joined Retro Fitness in January 2013. My contract has a very clear Expiration Date of January 30, 2014. So why today March 1, 2014 they are still charging my account? I called Retro Fitness in Manhawkin, NJ where I signed up. The girl on the phone told me I have to send a Certified Letter! to the Manahakin Retro Fitness so they can cancel. I asked to speak to a manager and guess what he is not there until Monday after 3pm? (Today is Saturday) I never received a phone call, email or Letter notifying me that they will automatic continue my contract and continue to charge my account. I called my bank and I am disputing the charges from them. This contract is Misleading and a Contract Of Entrapment. I will be sending out the certified letter. I hope this will resolve this issue as I have been reading all other complaints here. I will never sign up with them.</p>, <p>I went to the gym. They wrote down all the information to cancel and they told me THAT I CANCELLED. I asked them for a receipt, But they say it was not necessary. That was in August, and I still get a charge on my credit card. I think we need to get a class action lawsuit against them because there are way too many people in this boat.</p>, <p>I have been dealing with trying to cancel my membership since 9/21/13 but the owner never cancelled the membership. Worst yet, she never returned my phone calls until mid December. I went in person to resolve this issue, the owner Christina told me I still owed money. I asked her to explain why it took her three months to return my 5 phone calls. "You should have read your contract," it sounded like speaking to a robot. She is not listening, I have never heard of a ridiculous policy like this. I always paid my dues a month ahead, and she purposely didn't cancel the membership to squeeze more money out of me. </p>, <p>I have been trying to cancel my membership with Retro Fitness in Middletown since September 2013. A friend of mine is a personal trainer and had given me a workout to do. I had asked one of the guys where a certain machine was. He was at the counter reading a newspaper as if he couldn't be bothered. Upon seeing my notebook with my workout, he began to drill me about where I got my workout, who my friend was, where she trained, he was so rude. I tried to cancel my membership and was told you had to cancel in Manahawkin because my membership had been transferred there. The Middletown manager tried to say I was close to $300 behind on payments. </p>, <p>Retro let me sign up at the gym but when I asked about canceling my membership I was referred to a phone number. At this number I was on hold over 30 mins and had to drop off to get back to work on two occasions. When I finally got through to someone they of course had to transfer me to a specialist whose only specialties seemed to be refusing to acknowledge my request, dragging the conversation on as long as possible, and trying to talk me into not canceling. In the end a change of my CC number was the only thing that stopped the charges. Retro Fitness is a terrible company to deal with. Join at your own risk.</p>, <p>Please beware of Retro Fitness Astoria. If you JOIN, please be prepared to JOIN FOR LIFE. They will make quitting more of a workout than you ever had at the GYM. I joined August 2012 and after ONE year decided that I'd cancel the membership. In September 2013, I went ONLINE and submitted the cancellation as instructed. I received an email indicating that a member of the Retro Staff would contact me. I assumed they'd call to try and discourage me from quitting. I never received that call, but in good faith I assumed my membership had been cancelled. Another month, another charge. </p>, <p>On 11/13/2013 I was trained by Kyle at the Brick NJ location as part of the "FREE" fitness evaluation. At that time I agreed to sign up for weekly training. 2 days later I was contacted by a trainer at the facility who informed me he did not work on Saturdays. The following day Kyle said he would have someone that did work on weekends call me. On November 16th I received a text message from "Robb" to set up a training session. He informed me that day he would get back to me "early the following week" to set up the appointment. He did not reach out to me "early the next week."</p>, <p>I cancelled my membership 2 years ago. I went into the gym and signed a cancellation form. They never ended up canceling my membership and basically stole from me for 2 years. I should be paid back. To boot the owner is never there to speak to whenever there is an issue!</p>, <p>On 3/11, my mother and myself joined the Retro Fitness gym - 2571 Hempstead Tpke, East Meadow. After leaving, we both agreed we didn't like the atmosphere so we went to a different gym and joined there. The SAME night, we went back to Retro Fitness and told the SAME person who signed us up that we decided that gym wasn't for us. She ripped up our contracts and took our key chain scan passes. She told us that was it. I continued getting emails from them the days following so I called to make sure it was cancelled and was told "My sister and I run it. It was taken care of." </p>, <p>I cancel my account in Feb. 2013. They ask for a doctor's note that I gave and they still charge my credit card so I'm forced to sue them for my money.</p>, <p>Two sons joined well over a year ago, almost two years now. One son moved. He called to cancel, still being charged on his credit card. Sent a certified letter to East Meadow and home office in NJ to demand cancellation. Other son, being charged $29.00 and $19.99 for the month of August! Called them in East Meadow, they said have to come in person. What the hell?? Never heard of such crap in my life! Want the memberships cancelled! What a waste of $! Never would recommend this place EVER!</p>, <p>Worst gym I have EVER been to. Front desk was rude. 8 treadmills had OUT OF ORDER SIGN. I was told by another member the one I got on was broken and was waiting for a sign (and it was broken, I stayed 1 1/2 hours "trying" to get a good session in. When I left the treadmill still had no sign). Gym set up is tight and leaves no room to breathe. All the equipment is on top of the next. The bathroom was FILTHY. I could not find towelettes to wipe the equipment down (no one in the gym had the courtesy of wiping the equipment off after use I noticed). The weights were ALL over the floor and there were no handles on the machines to use the machines (I looked for 15 minutes for a handle, went to the desk to ask and was told they were "around" or being used. Not enough handles for the equipment they have?).</p>, <p>Good marketing strategy, $19.99, but you end up in paying $300 for sure when you cancel your membership. Stupid agreement, you don't get agreement at all. But they always say as per agreement... Don't go there.... Worst gym and customer service in the world. They look only for money and don't care about anything else. If you say treadmill is not working, no one will listen to you. But if you order smoothie or if you need personal trainer, they will come to your home also to serve you. </p>, <p>I joined Retro Fitness in Jersey City, Hudson Mall location on May 30th, 2013. I spoke with Mike, the manager, and asked questions. There was an error in my application and I had to go to the front desk to have someone check it out. The young lady asked if I meant to check off that I have High Blood Pressure and I told her yes. She said okay and put the application through. Again I asked Mike if there was anything else I needed to know; his answer was nope, I had answered everything. I said to him, "When can I start exercising?" He said to me, "Now. You are officially a member of the gym." </p>, <p>I joined Retro Fitness online on 5/19/13. Next day, I went to the gym in New Springville, Staten Island and spoke to the GM, Phillip. He told me it would be cheaper if I joined in the store. I had him cancel my order. I told him that when the money went back into my account (I used bank VISA/ATM), I would sign up. There were also medical issues that required a doctor's note. I suffered a stroke 9 weeks ago. To date, my account has not been credited.</p>, <p>I have been trying to cancel my membership since October of 2012. When I walked into the gym with my written request to cancel, the manager talked me into staying with a waiver until Dec. Come Dec. of 2012, I sent a letter to Retro in Monroe, NY that I was still getting charged the monthly fee. In Feb 2013, I sent another letter and as of May, I was still being charged. I called the Gym and no one would talk to me, all they could say was that I was in the system as PENDING CANCELATION. I called my credit card and we blocked them and disputed the charges. My credit card company and myself spoke to ABC Financial and I owed $40. Now I am in collections for $139.95. I called them and they said I owe that amount and I was supposed to send a certified letter to the corporate office. Funny how the manager never said that to me when I was standing in front of her. This gym is a rip off and HORRIBLE!</p>, <p>Retro Fitness in Manahawkin, NJ is a horrible gym. The lack of management is ridiculous. I have been trying to cancel the membership since early February 2013. Here is my story� In January of 2013, I moved to PA and spoke to a gym representative on the phone and I was told I had to cancel in person with new license. I drove almost four hours, handed my license to the guy behind deck. He took it, played with the computer, smiled, and said he canceled it. About a month later, I get a call from ABC Financial Services stating that my account was still open and I was overdue on my account. I had called the gym about 25 times to cancel and speak to the manager that is never ever there. </p>, <p>Retro Fitness representative of Route 440 in Jersey City, New Jersey is unprofessional and terribly lacking people skills and business acumen. First of all, Retro Fitness opened late after a continuous cry of opening soon. From the first day, they began to take email address and phone number boasting of $20 a month fee. Never once was I informed that there would be additional fees with the initial signing up. I agreed to pay whatever the cost. The problem began when I asked to have my billing date the first of the month. I also agreed to pay retro for the month of May with its eight remaining days. I am retired and get a check once a month on the 1st. In order to keep from having insufficient funds penalties, I asked humbly to begin on the 1st of the month. </p>]
