<p>Worst fitness ever, bad management, horrible people, and very racist. They will keep charging you even after you tell them you want to cancel. I told them I want to cancel my account because they treated me very bad and most of the machines are not working most of the time, and when I told them they said, "Ok but you have to pay 70% of what is remaining." I was like, "How does that make sense to pay 70% of the remaining monthly payments when I�m not gonna come anymore," they said it�s in the contract! Even that no one said anything when I was signing the contract, then I said, "Ok I�ll keep it and try to make a lemonade out of the lemon," but then few months later it gets worse so I was like, "No that�s enough. I don�t want to go to this place anymore."</p>
