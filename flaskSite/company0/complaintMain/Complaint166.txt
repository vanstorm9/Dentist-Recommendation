<p>I joined Retro Fitness online on 5/19/13. Next day, I went to the gym in New Springville, Staten Island and spoke to the GM, Phillip. He told me it would be cheaper if I joined in the store. I had him cancel my order. I told him that when the money went back into my account (I used bank VISA/ATM), I would sign up. There were also medical issues that required a doctor's note. I suffered a stroke 9 weeks ago. To date, my account has not been credited.</p>
