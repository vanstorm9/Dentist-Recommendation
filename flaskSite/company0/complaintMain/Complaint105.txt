<p>Went there on the 14th of May to check the gym facilities and got signed up to try Zumba class on the following Monday. Show up on Monday to benefit of the free class and the receptionist tells me my pass has expired. They have set it up to start on the 11th, which I was not ever there, and end it on the day I was supposed to start the class. It clearly was a mistake but the girl never even try to accommodate me with a good customer service. No alternative solution was provided but empty words. The trainer who could prove my story was on the phone for the longest time (also not really available on the day I visit the first time). I left. Definitely never will sign up for such a poor customer service fitness providers.</p>
