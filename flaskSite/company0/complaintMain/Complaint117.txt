<p>Received an advertisement from Retro Fitness, 11 Park Place, Paramus, New Jersey, advertising two choices of membership: 1. A year membership with $0 enrollment paying a processing fee of $21.39 and recurring monthly charge of 21.39 (with tax included) OR 2. A no contract membership paying $53.49 up front and recurring $21.39 per month (with tax included) with the stipulation you can drop out whenever you would like, but you lose the $53.49. The advertisement DOES NOT mention the charge of a fee of $41.73 in August for BOTH of these plans. If you visit the gym to sign up, you will not be told; if you sign up online, it is not apparent. YOU MUST READ THE TERMS CAREFULLY as I did before joining.</p>
