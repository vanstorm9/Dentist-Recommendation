<p>Good marketing strategy, $19.99, but you end up in paying $300 for sure when you cancel your membership. Stupid agreement, you don't get agreement at all. But they always say as per agreement... Don't go there.... Worst gym and customer service in the world. They look only for money and don't care about anything else. If you say treadmill is not working, no one will listen to you. But if you order smoothie or if you need personal trainer, they will come to your home also to serve you. </p>
