<p>I joined Retro Fitness in Easton, PA in July of 2011 and made my first attempt to cancel the membership in July 2012. I specifically waited until that time because of the one year commitment, not mentioned by the person at the gym, but hidden in the contract. I did this by calling the 800 number I was given at the local gym. Debits of my bank account continued and I called again in August of 2012. Still debits continued so I went to the location in person but again was told to call the 800 number. This time, late August, I sent written request to the only address I could find, that of the local gym.</p>
