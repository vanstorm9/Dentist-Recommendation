<p>My two sons (22 &amp; 16 y/o) signed up and paid upfront (they thought that what they paid was for the annual dues, but wasn't), it was just for the membership! They found out later that they need to pay every month for the monthly dues! Told them right away that they need to cancel that because they don't have money for that and just went for two months (July &amp; August, summer '13) and haven't got back because they got back to school! The bills kept coming and I even called them. They said my sons need to go there personally to cancel it! But when they went there they just showed them that they electronically signed-up for it and need to stay for one year and pay for the dues! My son who was 16 (whose a minor) even I told him that I'm not paying for it, settled the account but my other son just requested to hold his membership because he can't afford it! Now, there's this collection agency calling him everyday about this matter! </p>
