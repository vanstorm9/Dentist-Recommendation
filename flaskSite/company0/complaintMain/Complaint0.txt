<p>Unbelievable! I am very, very angry! Yes, I got poor when I was with this gym. No, they are not easy to work with. My option was either to stay with the gym or you are forced to make one or two payments as a final result. Yes, I had car problems which cost high amount of money and my account was depleted. So when the company tried to take the money out of my bank account, there was no money. Not intentional, but things happen. So what happens? A company hired by Retro Fitness for bullying and trying to delegate how you are going to pay and what due date or else! They didn't even try to work with you. I ended up with that horrible, bullying boss call by hanging up. They tried to call back and I did not answer, period! </p>
