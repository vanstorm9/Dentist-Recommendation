<p>I had been a member of Retro Fitness for a little over a year. I was happy with the facility. However, I moved out of state in early Sept. of 2012. I had spoken with the owner beforehand and he told me that I would have to send some info for proof of residence and they would cancel my membership. Okay, fine. I could get much info quickly enough. I called the facility and asked what proof would be sufficient enough. I did not have my license yet; I did have my water/sewer bill. That was okay. I faxed it and my machine said "transmitted" which means it was received. </p>
