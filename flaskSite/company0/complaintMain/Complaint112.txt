<p>What would an 82 year old woman whose husband recently passed away really do to warrant being asked to leave after over 5 years a member... mention to management that she was going to let corporate know of the equipment not working and it not being fixed. With that one complaint she was asked to leave and had her membership refunded. When I tried to contact management as to why no warnings, I received no response. Corporate heads should follow up to ensure that the local independently owned gyms are being held to the corporate standard that was originally set when the company was opened. I am very disappointed.</p>
