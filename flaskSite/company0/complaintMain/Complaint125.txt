<p>I originally signed up at a brand new Retro Fitness in Forked River, NJ. I signed up so I could get free classes for a year, it was a promotion. The building was still not ready but they had a little office set up. I just moved back to NJ from OR where I didn't have such problems as I do in NJ (NJ is a joke, don't live there if you don't have to). Anyway, I had to transfer my membership to Toms River on rt 37. I never took any classes at the Lacey Retro because they were not open yet, but I had a situation where I had to move kinda fast. So, Toms River and Lacey tell me in order to transfer my membership I have to check in 13 days out of the month. I checked it day after day after day after day and I would ask occasionally, "Did my membership change over?" "Not yet, not yet, not yet." </p>
