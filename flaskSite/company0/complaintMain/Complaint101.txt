<p>I have signed my son up for a Retro Fitness membership in December 2014. I was told he could cancel if need be but am having problem doing it. Since I attempted to cancel my charges have gone from 19.99 to 39.49.. I called and have not been able to speak to manager Amy directly in reference to why such high charges. I questioned extra charge and was told it's a fee cause my bank had insufficient funds. I have overdraft protection and it would not reject a request for payment. I also wanna note on days payment was requested I had sufficient funds in my checking account. I think this is unfair charging and am looking to get a refund of overcharges. Thank you for your time and assistance.</p>
