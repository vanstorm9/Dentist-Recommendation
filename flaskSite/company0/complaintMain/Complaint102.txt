<p>The male manager at Retro Farmingdale treated me rudely. Was passive aggressive by snarling, ignoring, and turning his back on me. I yelled at him and appeared as the aggressor. Asked for his manager and was ignored again. Had to ask three times. Called Debra ** and was told the employee was sterling. Was humiliated and abused.</p>
