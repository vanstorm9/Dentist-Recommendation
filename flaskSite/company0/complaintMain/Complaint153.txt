<p>I went to the gym. They wrote down all the information to cancel and they told me THAT I CANCELLED. I asked them for a receipt, But they say it was not necessary. That was in August, and I still get a charge on my credit card. I think we need to get a class action lawsuit against them because there are way too many people in this boat.</p>
