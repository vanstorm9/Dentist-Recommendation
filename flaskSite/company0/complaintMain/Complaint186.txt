[<p>Unbelievable! I am very, very angry! Yes, I got poor when I was with this gym. No, they are not easy to work with. My option was either to stay with the gym or you are forced to make one or two payments as a final result. Yes, I had car problems which cost high amount of money and my account was depleted. So when the company tried to take the money out of my bank account, there was no money. Not intentional, but things happen. So what happens? A company hired by Retro Fitness for bullying and trying to delegate how you are going to pay and what due date or else! They didn't even try to work with you. I ended up with that horrible, bullying boss call by hanging up. They tried to call back and I did not answer, period! </p>, <p>I had been a member of Retro Fitness for a little over a year. I was happy with the facility. However, I moved out of state in early Sept. of 2012. I had spoken with the owner beforehand and he told me that I would have to send some info for proof of residence and they would cancel my membership. Okay, fine. I could get much info quickly enough. I called the facility and asked what proof would be sufficient enough. I did not have my license yet; I did have my water/sewer bill. That was okay. I faxed it and my machine said "transmitted" which means it was received. </p>, <p>I have been a member for years and have recently found the conditions at this Howell Retro to be deplorable. This Saturday morning, there was toilet paper on the floor in the women's bathroom and it hadn't been cleaned. I also take offense to their sending me emails to advertise their other business venture, 21 South Bar and Grille. Not a particularly good connection to the health and fitness model they project.</p>, <p>Still been trying to contact the corporate office. Surprise! No answer! They take advantage of kids, especially. We have been trying to cancel membership since last August 2012. Still no luck!</p>, <p>I signed a contract for both a year of membership (Retro Fitness) and 6 months of PT. When I started to look at my bank statements, I saw they were not taking out the $19.99 they said was due but $40 each time. When I call and ask if someone is there that can help me, they set up a meeting and then the "manager" never shows up. I put a stop payment on my bank for them. But even before that, they sent me letters from their collection agency telling me I owe or they didn't have the right bank info, even though they were taking out double from my account the entire time. I paid my dues and just want to pay what I owe the next 6 months ($20 a month). I shouldn't have to fight. They take out double or keep charging me for the PT. I saw others� reviews and thought, �Well, that's out of state. Maybe mine wouldn't be like that since they make you feel taken cared of.� Bull! **. They are just out to ruin your credit and take your money and as long as I can pay them what I signed for, I'm fine. But until then, I will continue to tell my bank to not pay them at all no matter how much it hurts my credit.</p>, <p>Trying to cancel membership - I sent a registered letter, cancelling my policy mid-April 2012. I received a charge on my credit card end of April. I figured okay, just the residue. I got another charge end of May. I disputed bills for April and May. I received a letter from a collection agency stating I owe. I replied with the registered letter receipt number. They ignored the letter and sent another. I told my credit card company to not allow any more bills and they agreed. I just received a phone call from ABC Financial Services, saying it was urgent I respond. I did not. I did send another letter to the collection agency. We'll see how far this goes.</p>, <p>I went to sign up and check out with a friend. Since I'm only in Manahawkin during the summer (couple of months), I only wanted a short term program. They told me sure a student program, but I was not sure of it. So I declined and told them so. But since they ran my credit card, they would send me a check, which they did (check # ** for $160.47, noted-3 day cancellation refund). But then, they kept charging my credit card monthly. I had my lawyer send a letter of my cancellation and refund (3 day refund). Then they charged me back the refund amount. </p>, <p>Billing Dispute - I signed up for a one-year membership at Retro Fitness in Dix Hills/Huntington NY area, that was to continue each month after that year was up and would cost me $20, being charged to my credit card. First off I hardly used the membership because of a back injury. I had a 3 level lumbar fusion surgery done in November of 2010. I was cut open from an inch over my belly button, all the way down to the crotch line. My insides were taken out. They then took out 3 discs replacing them with spacers, 3 cages,with 9 screws to hold it all in place. They then put me back together, flipped me over and sliced me 3 times in my back, while inserting a Titanium rod and 2 more screws to hold that in place.</p>, <p>My daughter went to work out and take her free training session that came with her membership. Apparently, they sold her a year's training in the amount of $2000.00. At that time she was told that she could cancel anytime, but apparently this is not so. She feels embarrassed that she was taken advantage of. She is a college student with no income. We have tried to explain this to several people, but no one wants to hear anything.</p>, <p>My identity got stolen and I tried to have a civilized conversation with Charlie, the female owner of Retro Fitness, and she immediately began yelling that she doesn't care about my problem and I can simply pay what I owe to get out of the contract. I explained to her that that money was tied up due to fraud, but again, all she did was yell and constantly remind how she doesn't care about my problems and that I am "locked" in a contract and must pay or else she will send the collections after me. I asked twice for the corporate office and she hung up the phone. She hung up. Instead of talking, she resorted to childish behavior.</p>, <p>My 15 year old son went in to get information about the gym.  They let him fill out a gym membership and started to take money from his account.  Now this is on his credit report.  I would like his money to be returned to him and that you remove this off his credit report.</p>, <p>People like the owner/manager Michael Padula are tools. Let me define tool. A tool is an apparatus or a (person) to get something done. To some, the word tool may have a much stronger derogatory meaning, but to me, it's an oversimplified sort of person. My contract with Retro Fitness was terminated because Padula got complaints from his staff and clients. I was not notified that I had such a caustic effect on some of the folks in the space. Padula is a tool, and tools like Padula think very 2 dimensionally. There is no reason why a gym should be run by a tool. I am the gregarious/friendly sort. One very unique trait is I am bluntly honest. Most people cannot handle my level of complete transparency. Padula, members of his staff, and some clients are just too narrow-minded and ignorant to enjoy their surroundings, and the people around them. Live, love, enjoy!</p>, <p>I called the billing company to cancel contract at contract's end in 1 week. I was told I had to go to the health club to fill out "paperwork" to cancel. The health club manager insisted I needed to send a certified letter requesting termination. The contract specifically states written notice need to be provided 60 days prior to "auto renewal" I was told.  This is in direct violation of New Jersey code 56:8-42 in regulating health club contracts that states "A health club services contract shall not obligate the buyer to renew the contract." </p>, <p>I was offered and signed on for a comprehensive personal training program that included my past, present and future fitness goals, strength and endurance training and a diet program for weight loss. Upon my second visit I was informed that I would not be given a diet plan as they were not dietitians. I had informed the trainer that I had a low back and shoulder injury; however he continuously instructed me to perform exercises and/or lift weights too heavy for my fitness level. I received no endurance program, and when asked was told that I looked like I knew what I was doing. </p>, <p>On November 28, 2007, my 17 year old daughter entered a one year agreement with this gym. She had her monthly amount of 21.39 deducted from her checking account. On September 4, 2008, we sent a letter requesting that her membership be discontinued due to her attendance at college. We sent the letter certified mail, return receipt requested, as required on the contract. However, the letter came back to us stating there is no such address. We double-checked the address on the contract and it was clearly sent to the right address. </p>]
