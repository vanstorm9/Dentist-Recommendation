<p>Deer park - Employees are good but the owner could care less about the gym. The equipment is old and not maintained, the rubber grips are never replaced on any of it. The water fountain barely works and slowly spills out warm water, it's been that way for two years, the bathroom sinks don't work.. The place is a mess.</p>
