<p>I signed up to Retro Fitness a few years back, in the beginning I was going quite regularly, after a while I stopped going, but I didn't plan on canceling my membership as I was planning to start going again, then for some reason there was a problem with my credit card and the charge did not go through (that was well after a year of membership) so instead of canceling my membership, they continue to try charge my card and add a penalty charge, and then send it to collection. I think this is a total ripoff strategy by Retro Fitness, that's totally unheard of, every other company with such kind membership would just simple cancel your membership. I think a CLASS ACTION needs to be filed against them.</p>
