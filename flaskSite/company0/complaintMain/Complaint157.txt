<p>Please beware of Retro Fitness Astoria. If you JOIN, please be prepared to JOIN FOR LIFE. They will make quitting more of a workout than you ever had at the GYM. I joined August 2012 and after ONE year decided that I'd cancel the membership. In September 2013, I went ONLINE and submitted the cancellation as instructed. I received an email indicating that a member of the Retro Staff would contact me. I assumed they'd call to try and discourage me from quitting. I never received that call, but in good faith I assumed my membership had been cancelled. Another month, another charge. </p>
