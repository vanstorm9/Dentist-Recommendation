<p>I joined Retro Fitness in Jersey City, Hudson Mall location on May 30th, 2013. I spoke with Mike, the manager, and asked questions. There was an error in my application and I had to go to the front desk to have someone check it out. The young lady asked if I meant to check off that I have High Blood Pressure and I told her yes. She said okay and put the application through. Again I asked Mike if there was anything else I needed to know; his answer was nope, I had answered everything. I said to him, "When can I start exercising?" He said to me, "Now. You are officially a member of the gym." </p>
