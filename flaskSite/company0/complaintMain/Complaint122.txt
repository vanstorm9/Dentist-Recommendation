<p>I walked into Retro Fitness in Neptune NJ with my sister-in-law. A girl at the counter told me that she would help me with a 7-day trial period with no membership needed, that she would need two forms of ID and to pay for the trial. I paid for the trial on the account that the attendant behind the counter stated that Retro would not take money out of my account without my consent. </p>
