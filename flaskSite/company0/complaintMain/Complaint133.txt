<p>I cancelled my son's account on May 13, 2014. They told me I need to pay for the next two months so I transferred his account to my name. At the end of July, I should have been done. So I thought, and on August 1, 2014 they charge me $29.00 for an annual fee and I call and the response I got was that everyone gets charged. Well that's fine if everyone did not cancel. She told me I need to call the billing company and discuss it with them. I informed her that's not my job and I don't get paid to do her job. I left a message for a manager to call back, but because it was a weekend, apparently they have no managers on until Monday. I waited and did not receive a call back. </p>
