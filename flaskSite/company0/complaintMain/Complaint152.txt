<p>I joined Retro Fitness in January 2013. My contract has a very clear Expiration Date of January 30, 2014. So why today March 1, 2014 they are still charging my account? I called Retro Fitness in Manhawkin, NJ where I signed up. The girl on the phone told me I have to send a Certified Letter! to the Manahakin Retro Fitness so they can cancel. I asked to speak to a manager and guess what he is not there until Monday after 3pm? (Today is Saturday) I never received a phone call, email or Letter notifying me that they will automatic continue my contract and continue to charge my account. I called my bank and I am disputing the charges from them. This contract is Misleading and a Contract Of Entrapment. I will be sending out the certified letter. I hope this will resolve this issue as I have been reading all other complaints here. I will never sign up with them.</p>
