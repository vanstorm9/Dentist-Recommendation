<p>My credit card is on file with Retro Fitness because they take our monthly gym dues out which I gave them permission by signing their contract. After being members for close to 3 years my son was approached by one of the personal trainers about this supposedly great deal where he would have a personal trainer and it would only cost about 30$ a month and he could cancel anytime. So my son, even though he was 21 at the time was very gullible and trusting so he signed the contract. When he came home and told me about it I told him to go back and cancel it. </p>
