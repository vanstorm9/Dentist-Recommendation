<p>Customer service is a very low (non existent) priority of **, the woman who owns this gym. Recently, over a period of many days some equipment was malfunctioning and staff didn't know when repairs would be made. For a number of days I asked that the owner please contact me. She never responded. On Sunday April 5th she was at the gym but avoided me. I asked why I never heard from her. Her response was if I'm dissatisfied she will cancel my membership; and that I should "get the hell out of there immediately; and that if I didn't she would call the police." I told her "yes, please cancel the membership and let me have a receipt confirming cancellation." Again, I was told to get the hell out of there or she would call the police. Any requests for information about this gym from others will definitely be met with "Do not join!"</p>
