<p>The gym facility is horrible. It's too crowded. The stretching space has boxing equipment in the same area so when you're over there, you're likely gonna encounter somebody banging on the boxing equipment which is really, really loud. The General Manager has the worst attitude, which I found out wasn't unique to me. I asked some of the other members and they all had the same experience.</p>
