<p>On 11/13/2013 I was trained by Kyle at the Brick NJ location as part of the "FREE" fitness evaluation. At that time I agreed to sign up for weekly training. 2 days later I was contacted by a trainer at the facility who informed me he did not work on Saturdays. The following day Kyle said he would have someone that did work on weekends call me. On November 16th I received a text message from "Robb" to set up a training session. He informed me that day he would get back to me "early the following week" to set up the appointment. He did not reach out to me "early the next week."</p>
