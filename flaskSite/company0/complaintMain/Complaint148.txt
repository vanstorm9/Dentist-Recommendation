<p>My situation is similar to other complaints that I've read. I cancelled my membership because of medical issues but I did complete my year membership so that I was not charged the penalty for cancelling early. I had fully planned on going back once my arm and shoulder were healed but in the meantime, my wallet was stolen with all of my credit cards in it so I cancelled my cards. Because they could not charge my card, I am being harassed by the company that bills for them. I had already met my year commitment so I do not understand why they didn't just cancel when I requested. I called the NE Philadelphia location and was instructed to email **, the General Manager, and he would take care of it. I have not had one response from **. In my email, I told them the card that they would try to charge was not valid and explained the situation. I will never go back now and will try to warn everyone that will listen what a ripoff this company is!! Go to LA Fitness. It costs more but is well worth it!</p>
