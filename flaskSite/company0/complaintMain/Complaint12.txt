<p>I called the billing company to cancel contract at contract's end in 1 week. I was told I had to go to the health club to fill out "paperwork" to cancel. The health club manager insisted I needed to send a certified letter requesting termination. The contract specifically states written notice need to be provided 60 days prior to "auto renewal" I was told.  This is in direct violation of New Jersey code 56:8-42 in regulating health club contracts that states "A health club services contract shall not obligate the buyer to renew the contract." </p>
