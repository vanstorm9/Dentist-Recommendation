<p>I have been trying to cancel my membership since October of 2012. When I walked into the gym with my written request to cancel, the manager talked me into staying with a waiver until Dec. Come Dec. of 2012, I sent a letter to Retro in Monroe, NY that I was still getting charged the monthly fee. In Feb 2013, I sent another letter and as of May, I was still being charged. I called the Gym and no one would talk to me, all they could say was that I was in the system as PENDING CANCELATION. I called my credit card and we blocked them and disputed the charges. My credit card company and myself spoke to ABC Financial and I owed $40. Now I am in collections for $139.95. I called them and they said I owe that amount and I was supposed to send a certified letter to the corporate office. Funny how the manager never said that to me when I was standing in front of her. This gym is a rip off and HORRIBLE!</p>
