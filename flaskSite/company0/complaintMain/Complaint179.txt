<p>My daughter went to work out and take her free training session that came with her membership. Apparently, they sold her a year's training in the amount of $2000.00. At that time she was told that she could cancel anytime, but apparently this is not so. She feels embarrassed that she was taken advantage of. She is a college student with no income. We have tried to explain this to several people, but no one wants to hear anything.</p>
