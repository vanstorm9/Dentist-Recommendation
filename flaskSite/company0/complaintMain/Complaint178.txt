<p>Billing Dispute - I signed up for a one-year membership at Retro Fitness in Dix Hills/Huntington NY area, that was to continue each month after that year was up and would cost me $20, being charged to my credit card. First off I hardly used the membership because of a back injury. I had a 3 level lumbar fusion surgery done in November of 2010. I was cut open from an inch over my belly button, all the way down to the crotch line. My insides were taken out. They then took out 3 discs replacing them with spacers, 3 cages,with 9 screws to hold it all in place. They then put me back together, flipped me over and sliced me 3 times in my back, while inserting a Titanium rod and 2 more screws to hold that in place.</p>
