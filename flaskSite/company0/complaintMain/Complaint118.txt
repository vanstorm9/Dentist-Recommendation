<p>I just complained to BBB. I have also complained with all the Retro Fitness managers (Anthony, Adam, Betsy), and Retro Fitness Corporate (John Michael from customer services) with no effect. The gym is clean but avoid their personal training services. If you have problems with it, they won't help you resolve it. Once you sign a 12 month contract you are stuck. They have lied to me, not honored their word, provided the worst customer service I have ever experienced and implied I am lying. They have been unprofessional by not keeping scheduled appointments.</p>
