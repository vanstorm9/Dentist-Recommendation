<p>I joined the club on 1/27/15 but I was waiting for a job that I applied. The job came through on Wednesday 1/29/15 just 2 days after joining. I told them my job is 2 hours away from my home state, and I have the need to stay here and visit my state only on weekends. I need that time to spend with my kids. I try to cancel the contract but nobody help me. Also at front nobody tell you that you will be charge 40 dollars after 6 months using the gym, beside the 20 dollars of monthly fee. They are fake. I hope that all of them end up in jail.</p>
