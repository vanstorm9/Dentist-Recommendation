Endodontist,"1355 15th St, Fort Lee, NJ 07024",root canal,healthfirst,spanish,(609) 474-8080,"If I did need one, I would not hesitate to call Dr. Bui. :D"
Endodontist,"2999 Princeton Pike #4, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648",root canal,unitedhealthcare,chinese,(609) 587-0001,"Trust his ""Golden Hands"" and you wont leave disappointed :)"
Endodontist,"1357 15th St, Fort Lee, NJ 07024",root canal,healthfirst,korean,(609) 454-6788,I highly recommend Dr Bui and his team if ever need a root canal or whatever other services they offer.
Endodontist,"12 Roszel Rd, Princeton, NJ 08540",root canal,unitedhealthcare,arabic,(609) 228-3200,Dr Bui was very friendly and very helpful with any follow up questions I had. e.g. I had a lot of pain due to my infection before I had my treatment and he took the time to prescribe the right pain meds for me and advised on next steps and healing process. 
Endodontist,"1359 15th St, Fort Lee, NJ 07024",root canal,healthfirst,spanish,(609) 509-4090,"He tried to numb me and I told him from the beginning that the numbing takes longer in my system for some reason, and he acknowledged it and told me it was ok, after he injected me, he didn't wait not even 15 minutes and then told me he wouldn't have enough time to do it and he sent me home with half my face numb without any work done. Really ridiculous. And on top of that he TRIED to charge me for that. He is the WORST. Do NOT ever take him."
