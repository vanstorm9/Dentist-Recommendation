Current user [though the 3-month subscription is set not to renew on PayPal]. This is my second time on Match [last was back in 2012 – quite honestly, I met many quality women — dated a gem I met on Match for 4 years. Just a few observations so far, FWIW: Match pads your daily matches with fake accounts. Easy to spot: most often a single photo. Minimal, generic “About Me” copy. A quick “Search by image” on “images.Google.com” routinely results in stock images. Obviously, management’s boilerplate response might be: we’re a global site – impossible to stop, catch and block all fake accounts. Whether blatantly deceitful on Match’s part or not, it’s up to you to decide.
