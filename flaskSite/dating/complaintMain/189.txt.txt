The following is what I wrote them. You can copy and paste to comment on their site. I sent them this same message several times. "I would like to bring these next questions to your attention. Why are profiles with no photos shown to me when I specifically checked “ONLY matches that have photos”? I am constantly shown profiles that have no pictures. I’m beginning to think that you invent those profiles to give false hope. Would you respond to someone who sends you a like, email, or fave without a picture? I didn’t think so. Very frustrating! Also, why is it that I’m spoonfed profiles at a time? Shouldn’t I be able to see as many profiles as I wish? I find it very suspicious and dishonest on your part of not showing true Profiles of real people with photos."
