Match.com also renewed my membership without my consent. I did delete my hidden profile, only to be told I would stay on their database for quite a while. They keep saying they want to help and reimbursed my money, but it's the same sad story that I must log in. How can a person log in when I deleted. It goes back to that problem of staying in their database. I feel for all those people who are honest and caring, who are genuine. I just wish we that have had problems should get closer to bring Match.com down, even when living in different countries. There are ways. I read that Match.com are not accredited with Consumeraffairs.com. I feel the sentence I just wrote says it all.
