I signed up for a year not realizing that it was going to charge me all at once, which I definitely can’t afford. The only people I’m being matched with are so far out of my age range that it’s uncomfortable (some close to being old enough to be my grandfather — I’m 25 for reference). I sent an email explaining my dissatisfaction &amp; requested a refund. Waiting to see what they say. If they initially refuse, I’ll fight like hell to get my money back.
