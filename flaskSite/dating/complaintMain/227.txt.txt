I joined Match.com one day and the next day kept getting men who were overseas who wanted to continue chatting but not on Match.com, or replies with email addresses and phone numbers for me to call someone else they thought would be interested in me. I requested a refund from Match.com and was told they do not refunds even with the scammers. I have reported each scammer to Match.com as I get them since I am stuck with the membership until Oct 2018. Not my idea of a good dating service website. I tried them after being catfished and was surprised that not even a day went by and it all started all over again.
