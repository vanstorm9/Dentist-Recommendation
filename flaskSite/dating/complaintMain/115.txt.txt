Many women on this site are obviously fake profiles. When you live in Alaska and multiple girls are smoking hot models with profile pictures in the Bahamas and generic descriptions like "Just looking for a nice guy; I love music food and adventure," it starts to set off red flags. No one responds, because who know who's even subscribed? Also, if you are an international traveler, don't count on being able to use this site outside of the United States. Your subscription only seems to work in the country of origin.
