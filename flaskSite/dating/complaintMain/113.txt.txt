The worst money ever spend in my life. Half of profiles are fake and the other half did close their account but their pictures are still on Match. So when you close your account make sure that you delete the pictures first. Before you go out with any of this girls don't be afraid or shy to ask them if they take any type of medication. Don't go out for lunch or dinner because it may turn out that you don't like each other and then you're stuck.
