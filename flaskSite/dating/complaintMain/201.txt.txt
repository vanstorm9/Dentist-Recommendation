Months after meeting my wife on Match, we went back to look at my profile online. My profile had been taken over with the pictures changed. Many e-mails were being sent and received, which can only be done with membership, which I no longer had. It was pretty obvious that Match was using my fake account to hook members. I knew this was a practice, as any time I cancelled my membership, I got a flood of e-mails that required a membership to read. Fast forward to no longer with my wife. I tried to get my profile back, explaining what had happened, and was told that I couldn't have my account back.
