As a Match.com member, I recently subscribed to a Match.com event. I was trying to find as much as possible about the event before submitting the order and, as I clicked on a button labeled LEARN MORE I was instantly charged with no possibility to review or cancel the order. I still want to attend the event but I am unpleasantly surprised by this experience.
