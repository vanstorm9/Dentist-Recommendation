Updated on 01/31/2019: For many weeks leading up to the end-date of my account, I received the daily 'new matches' email. The overwhelming majority of the 'matches' were recycled profiles from prior 'new match' emails. I only had the occasional notification of my profile being viewed and rarely had a "like" message from another profile. This is due to the fact that the majority of profiles are inactive (at some point they were a paying member, or they signed up for a free weekend, etc).
