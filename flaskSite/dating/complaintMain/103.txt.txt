After using this site for the last 6 months I can’t believe their new year advertising campaign for 2019. They’ve based the advert on fake news. How ironic when everything about this dating site is fake. Half of their members are no longer members and very few people live in your local area. I would have cancelled my membership after the first hour if this was possible. In addition to this these people will take another payment from your bank account unless you cancel your subscription so read the small print. I know other people with the same views who have also been caught out. Save your money, ignore the fake advertising campaign and join a different site. Please note these people also own Plenty of Fish and numerous other sites. Check them out as I’m sure the same crafty habits apply.
