I've been trying to edit my profile for months now to no avail. It looked ridiculous, appeared as one long paragraph. I called and wrote many times to no avail. I was told they were aware of it and were looking into it just yesterday. I spoke to a very condescending woman after telling them in the Philippines I wanted to speak to someone in the U.S., who told me she met someone on Match so it works, lol. I told her it didn't work for women over 50 and that I wanted my profile fixed or wanted a refund or I was filing a complaint with the TX State Attorney General. This morning I get an email that my profile contains something offensive and will not be approved. I called again, got the Philippines and said I wanted again to speak to someone in the U.S.
