I have been on the site for nearly 8 months. Wrote full profile, pictures. Educated and look good. Was perplexed that I never got more than one response to a question and didn't hear anything from most. Match runs all their promotions and "premiums this and that" to boost their database. I finally went into detail with a representative tonight about what I long suspected. They said they don't divulge who they’re paying and non paying customers/subscribers are on the site??? Essentially, you see all these people out there that appear to be available and trust me, very few are.
