I found a Groupon for 74% off the normal price. There is NO COUPON OR PROMO CODE! Once you click on the Groupon it brings you to the Match.com site. (I had already signed up earlier, just not paid. I wanted to see how the site worked prior to buying. With limited access I was happy at the time.) I will do anything to save money. So, using the Groupon was the only reason I paid! I wasn't going to pay $131.94 for a dating site that I only got to see part of and there are plenty of free sites that I could use.
