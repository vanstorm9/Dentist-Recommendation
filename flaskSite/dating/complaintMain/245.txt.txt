For past experience in other bridal services, even if you are not a subscriber they let you see who has seen your profile, who has written you and even show you the letters. With Match.com there's not such a thing. You have to pay to see anything. They keep sending you that you're getting noticed, letters, etc, but you have to pay to see who sent you stuff or looked at your profile. Very deceiving. Do NOT recommend, don't waste your money just to find out those who wrote you or wink or whatever are not even even close to what you're looking for. It's a lottery. I joined another, saw who I liked, said hi, she sent me a letter, at least I know who she was. No guessing Match BS.
