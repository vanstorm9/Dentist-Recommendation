First and foremost, I tried emailing Match.com to let them know that I needed them to contact me because I was a victim of a scammer on their website! No response!!! Women!! Please be aware that I was scammed and robbed of $28,000 because I was gullible to what was happening to me. DO NOT Give anyone money if they ask you or even iTunes cards. I had no idea that you can purchase a card and they can deplete funds. I’m embarrassed and ashamed of how naive I was to believing a lot of lies! I think that Match needs to have better security.
