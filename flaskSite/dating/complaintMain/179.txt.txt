In April of this year (2018), I paid for a 6 month subscription to Match.com. The terms say that if you don’t cancel before the 6 months are up, that you will be charged that amount again when it is time to renew. Before that time was up, I tried signing into my account to cancel my subscription but the email and password I always used all of a sudden wouldn’t work. I clicked to reset my password but the reset email never showed up. I went to my local bank and paid for a “stop transaction” on my account to block the name that Match used to take the money out under back in April however, when the day came to renew, they took the money out of my account under a different name which still screwed me out of my money. I contacted Match using their customer service email and phone number. Emailed them twice and never heard back.
