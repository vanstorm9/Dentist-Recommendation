I have been on there for 4 months and only met one person. Signed up for 6 month membership thinking it would save me money. Now Match has gone to the steps of if you don't meet someone in 6 months and write at least 5 new people per month they will extend the membership. Hell if you don't find at least one person in 6 months why extend it? Waste of money.
