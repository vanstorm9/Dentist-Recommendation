I was on Match for 15 days. My membership was for three months. I deleted my account after going on three dates with three men. The men (I encountered) on Match are looking for hook ups. This site makes you feel dirty to be on it. Most of the men that contacted me misrepresented themselves. Match needs to verify age by asking for social security numbers of prospective members. I want to strongly warn women about how predatory this site is. No matter how conservative your photos are many of the members only want one thing. Men on Match always want you to give them your phone number and get off the Match platform. Once they have your number they are a completely different person.
