I signed up for the site with some encouragement from some friends that maybe the free dating sites are hard to meet someone because the people aren't as serious. So I said ok I'll try a paid one. I landed on Match because I trusted the commercials. I was sent an offer for %50 off. Good thing that's all I had to pay. I made my profile and started finding women that matched with me. I had a few matches within the first few hours. I sent EVERY woman that "liked" my profile. No replies. I tweaked my profile and kept looking and messaging people.
