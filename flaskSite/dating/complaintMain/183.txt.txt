When you email people that you are interested in around your age group with common interests along with the features that they want, no one ever responds to your email. This is a total waste of my precious time. There is a reason people join the on line dating because they have a hard time meeting others. People don't review your profile as in a case with me, I was finally going to meet some one for coffee, then they flaked off the day before because of religion. I'm open to meeting new and different people. Have not meet one person in person, people say they are interested in you, you respond to them and never hear back. Will never use this site again.
