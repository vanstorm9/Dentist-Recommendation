The problem with Match.com is that much like every other dating site out there it's let down by the users. It's full of Judgemental people who are only looking for someone who is perfect and Ghosters who stop responding when you start to arrange to meet. It's a humongous waste of time and money. I would only recommend match if you look like Brad Pitt or something similar as that is your only chance of getting a response. You'd be better off using any other free dating site where exactly the same thing happens but you don't have to pay a premium to be blocked or ignored.
