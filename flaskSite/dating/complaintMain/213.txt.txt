I have been on Match for around a month. I get lots of views. Most men that write are from out of town, too young, too old, and foreign. The very young men write women without reading their profile. The older men try to get women much younger. The ones around your age just say Hello or How are you? or tell me more. Most men on Match get a lazy profile with equally bad photos. They are just checking it out. It amazes me that lazy profiles and lazy messages are so prevalent on Match. Almost all the men on Match need to pay someone to bring them into this decade of looks, clothing and how to date. Most women say the same thing.
