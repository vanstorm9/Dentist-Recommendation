I signed up for Match around Nov 1st. But only as a free membership. I did so cause there was an old classmate from high school as a member. So I figured why not now. I never had any bad interaction with this classmate in school, etc. So finally I get the $ to become a paid member Nov 30th. I'm not a paid member more than an hour and a half. I all sudden didn't feel right. I started to have internet problems. I get kicked. I go to re-sign in but forgot my password so I send for a link to replace said password.
