I had signed up for a 6 month membership with Match and had some contacts. Mostly men who said they were engineers. One asked for $5000 to buy a new part for the oil rig he was working on. I then cut him off. Other men were looking for a "God fearing woman"... Come on. Who would want to be with this kind of man? I canceled my membership because I met a man from another dating site. I'm sure I checked the box for no renewal of membership, however when I looked at my credit card bill I was charged with a renewal.
