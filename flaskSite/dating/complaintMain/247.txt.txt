Many of the correspondence I received were scammers. Always started with the same compliments and excitement on wanting to meet me but after a week later would receive message from the website security that they've pulled the account and warned against contacting this person. After a few months I had mostly these types of matches and decided that it was safer to just cancel. Very expensive and not even a single match that was real.
