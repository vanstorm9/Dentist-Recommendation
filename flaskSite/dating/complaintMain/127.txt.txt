First off, do not subscribe to this scam of a website. Despite what the commercials and "results" say, Match.com is an atrocity of a dating site. After surveying this site for years, I can safely say this site is a scam. From my own experience, during "working hours," there have been regularly between 60-65 members showing as "active." Yet in the evening, when you would think more people are searching, it drops by 85% to maybe 5-10 AT MOST. Doesn't this seem fishy? Well it is. It's because these profiles are either made and handled by Match.com employees or they are regularly made active to present the facade to browsing users in order to lure them into subscribing, only to then see the witch behind the mask they are wearing.
