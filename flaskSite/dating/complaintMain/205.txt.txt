If I could give Match zero stars, I would. Please save your money and sanity, and read this review. I subscribed to Match for 3 months and immediately regretted it. It went from bad to bizarre to scary in 3 days. 1. I discovered most of my “matches” were free/unpaid subscribers — some profiles were as old as 17 years! One man had a photo dated 2001; another had a photo of himself with a laptop image of the date — 2008; another man listed his age as 48 in his profile summary but his field-generated age (the age that appears with your user name and city) was 58, meaning he probably opened an account years ago and forgot about it. When I asked Match about this, they said they keep all free accounts viewable to “expand their subscriber base.” In other words, free accounts are used to lure others in.
