I signed up for the 6 month 'deal', which the site defaults for, with the idea that you 'only' pay a certain amount per month. Actually, you pay in full upfront. Your 'matches' are based on nothing other than age and distance. No matter what and how many times you put something more meaningful into the search parameters. Despite it being a paid-for membership, constant flashing adverts make the experience on the desktop version a visual nightmare, sort of a 1980s disco without decent music (and without any appealing men!).
