Match.com came up with this new ** "For your safety, please request a new password" and lockout profiles time to time and make users keep requesting for new password countless times in a week, how senseless even banks don't make users request for a new password time to time because that will make users to be giving out too much information to cyber world. When most wise users don't even use their real email on dating site Match is trying to make it mandatory to use real email and make users give more information and make them more vulnerable and various aspects. Instead of Match.com to deal with pressing matters like reducing their charges and give members more appropriate matches, they are busy with irrelevant matter "For your safety, please request a new password" that would make many members abandon the site.
