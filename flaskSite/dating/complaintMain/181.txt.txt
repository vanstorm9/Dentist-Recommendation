Awful experience. They are just interested in taking your money and will say whatever they like. They have something called shuffle which I innocently tried. It comes up with a photo and age and you have to say yes or no to liking them. I'm polite and don't like to say that I don't like someone, particularly when I haven't seen any details of them. I was horrified to find them all in my favourites box! When I googled, it showed me how to remove them but when I tried, it wouldn't work so I called Match and they told me that they were aware of the problem and were working on it. I called 2 months later only to be told that I had been given the wrong information and that they have removed that feature. I also had very inappropriate messages from some men. If you are looking for a quality man ladies, be very careful here! Will never use Match again.
