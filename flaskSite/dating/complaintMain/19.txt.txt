These people are thieves and first class cons. They show your profile to everyone and even give you fake likes and interests to get you to pay up. Once you're subscribed, they hide your profile or limit its exposure. Access to my account was blocked after a week for no reason. I had not broken any rules nor posted anything provocative, distasteful or illegal. You can have access blocked to your account for no reason and because you checked off the user agreement, you're out of your money. Never experienced such shenanigans on any other platform. You literally have to subpoena them to reveal the reason why they blocked your access. Prospective users: BE WARNED.
