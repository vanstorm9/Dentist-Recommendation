Match.com LLC is a waste of money. Many of the profiles are NOT paid members. The difference is you either pay or you have no access. They like to call all profiles a members. When you call which is limited non-customer service hours. 9-5 Texas time you will speak to the Philippines, Central America or TX. The phone reps are not helpful. I was working on my profile and was going to join, however they blocked my account. They won't tell you on the phone and say it will take 24-48 hours for an EMAIL reply. Search the internet for class actions against Match. Too bad the judges have thrown the cases out. I guess buyer beware.
