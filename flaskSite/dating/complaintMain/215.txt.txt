I tried Match because I work a lot. So a family member suggested that I try the whole online dating scene. So, I thought I would give Match a try. Not even 5 min of having it, I had buyer's remorse. I tried to call and email with no luck of getting a hold of someone outside of their business hours of 8-5 m-f :(. Then when I looked at the matches, none of them matched what I really wanted. I've tried Eharmony in the past and had a similar situation of the whole buyer remorse and there was someone to talk to with no problem and they gave me a refund. I cannot believe that Match.com is like this. I wish I would have read the reviews before signing up with them. Now I am going to be out of money, because I thought I was signing up for a quality on-line dating service that ended up being a nightmare!!!
