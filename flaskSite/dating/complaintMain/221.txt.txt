Don't risk using Match.com unless you want them to be taking your money even after canceling the service. I've canceled twice and still no email confirmation or anything. You cancel and they just keep charging. I canceled the same month I joined because I didn't like the site and thought it was too expensive considering it was no better than the free ones. They still charged me for the following month even though I'd canceled. This is still unresolved. I don't know how they get away with ripping people off.
