I have been a member of Match.com on-and-off for a couple decades. Yes DECADES. Early this month I noticed a charge on my card that indicated I had been charged for an Automatic Renewal of my Match.com account. When I joined this most recent time (last summer?), I remember distinctly checking the "Do Not Auto-Renew" button on the membership page, because I decided that this would be my "last hurrah".
