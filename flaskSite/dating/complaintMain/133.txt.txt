You used to get read notifications for free as part of the membership, now they're $2.99 a month. Beyond that, the membership is useless. You have to pay to message/respond to people, but most people don't pay. So you have to pay even more to let non-paying members respond. They should just charge a higher upfront fee and include all that ** instead of nickel-and-diming you after the fact.
