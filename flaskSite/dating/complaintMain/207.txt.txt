Last year I joined Match and they charged me after I canceled my subscription which was resolved after a long hassle. I joined in 2018 knowing the steps to take when I wanted to cancel my subscription, I canceled it one month later after I join because I met someone. I went in and cancelled my subscription and took a photo of the screen that showed that I cancelled it and deleted my account. 6 months later I was charged!! I called them and they said I never canceled it. I know clearly now that they are scammers. They gave me a refund but kept $13 because they said the month already started - even though I never signed in for 6 months and thought my account was deleted this whole time! I told them that I want to be out of their system completely and to make sure my account was deleted! I would not be surprised if I get charged 6 months later lol - ridiculous and bad business practices!!
