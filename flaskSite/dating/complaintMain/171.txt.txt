The website is a total mess and the interface is very poor. I've been on a less popular sites that aren't big funded &amp; mainstream like Match that have easier to use mechanics (mechanics that won't make the site terminate you over an accidental edit). I kept getting the same old people and same matches. I joined just out of curiosity because I wanted to profile browse (had the account for at least a week). I had to make a profile to do that so I decided might as well give this a try to see if I can find someone. I got lots of views and likes. Even messages but you have no way of replying back to these messages men send you UNLESS they themselves buy a separate package ($10 or so) that allows people they message to be able to respond back FREE regardless of membership status.
