I thought I might have a decent experience and at least make some new friends of the opposite sex. Most messages you send are never answered. Same profiles of the same people are sent to you over and over. They trick you into automatic renewals of your subscription. Make sure to go into setting and stop auto renewals. Then when you cancel at the end of your subscription... suddenly Match sends you daily emails of all the women who are suddenly interested in you. What a scam! You can't cancel the emails or get in touch with customer support unless you pay to subscribe again! Scammers should be put out of business.
