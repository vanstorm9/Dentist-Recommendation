I found my self accidentally signed up for Match.com. I immediately cancelled the subscription I had signed up for, and received a confirmation email that my account was closed. Both these events happened within 3 minutes of each other. The amount of the subscription, however was quickly withdrawn from my account. After a couple of weeks of not seeing the fee refunded, I called their customer service number. I was told that the "window to request a refund" was closed! WHAT? How can you send me a confirmation that my account has been closed, but keep my money?
