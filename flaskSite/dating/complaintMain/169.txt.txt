I have never seen such a disappointing, dishonest and money grabbing site in all my life. You call yourself Match... well you don’t Match people. I have asked for profiles with pictures only. Over my 3 months, I’ve had too many profiles that didn’t have photos. You stopped sending these to me when I wrote to complain. I asked for people between 58 and 68. You’ve sent me so many profiles of men ranging between the ages of 50 to 58. You’ve sent me Matches of men who are looking for women between 40 and 55 years old. Not only are you dishonest to me but also dishonest to men. I’m 65 yrs old. Can you not do the math. Now how is that a Match for me. You said that you have over 100 000 members on Match. Why is it that YOU decide how many matches or should I say fictions matches I see in a week.
