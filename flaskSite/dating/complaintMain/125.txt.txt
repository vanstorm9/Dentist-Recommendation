Tired of being single after a divorce, I made the leap and signed on to Match.com. I'm here to tell you that just about every negative review you read on this consumer review page is, unfortunately true. I wish I had read all these reviews before paying for my subscription but I didn’t. Of over 325 "would-be" matches, the majority were either out of date, fake or non-paying members...which means they can't even respond to a message you may send if you have an interest.
