Hi, I opened an account on Match.com, followed the instructions, uploaded a (nice) picture as requested, didn't take the time to write a text, figuring I had to think it over and would do it later. The next day, when I tried logging on, I got a message that my account was blocked and to contact customer service which I did. Here is their response: "Your Match account has been terminated. Due to our privacy practices, we cannot disclose specifics about any Match account, including your own." So, they refuse to tell me the reason why they terminated my own account. I say, don't bother with that site, look elsewhere.
