Unlike a lot of the reviews that seem highly subjective - (OMG, it's Match.com's fault that my dating experience was so bad). Give me a break people, sounds more like a YOU problem. I'll just stick to the facts. Using various techniques that I won't go into here - I was able to figure out with 99% certainty that people who work for Match.com intentionally create fake profiles using stock photos or Google Image Search (thank you, Google!) results. They will intentionally word profiles to grant you "hits," in your search parameters and even send you messages - All in the hope that they'll sucker you into subscribing.
