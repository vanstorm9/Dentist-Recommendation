I signed up with a discount offer. A few years ago I had signed up and had no problem finding the link to deactivate auto renewal. Not this time! Good luck figuring out the link to click - accounts didn't work, and I think I clicked auto sign in instead of deactivating renewal. Asked PayPal for help and they refused. Bad deal.
