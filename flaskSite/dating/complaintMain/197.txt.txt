This company is predatory in the sense that they make promises that they cannot keep and once you have paid for a membership, consider your money lost. The algorithms they use do not even find common matches. It only matches what you has selected as preferences, but ignores those things that you list as not acceptable. Also, if you are looking for a match local, forget it. You can set the range for your zip code to 10 miles and you still get matches several hundred miles away. In fact, it is probably a less than 10% chance that you would see 30 postings and more than 3 or 4 are local. I would have not given any stars, but that is not an option. Save your money and buy a nice dinner.
