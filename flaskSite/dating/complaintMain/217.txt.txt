Paid for subscription and have not been able to log in for months. Finally I realized I'm paying for this and I can't even access the site. So I call. Sent emails to support at Match. Then next day I do a chat with someone and explain the problem. No help at all. Tells me she's going to escalate my issue to the people at Match.com. (So who have I been talking to? An outsourced service that doesn't care, obviously.) And at the end she abruptly end the chat. I downloaded the chat history... Then I call customer service and I get an outsourced person who is obviously in the Philippines. He rambles the responses he's reading off from his manual. No emotion and no intellectual understanding of what I'm tell him. Ends the call with, "I will inform tech support about your issue." So frustrate. After paying for months of service I have been able to log in on maybe twice in the last 3 months.
