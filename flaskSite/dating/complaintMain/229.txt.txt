I signed up for Match.com and was able to browse around for a couple of hours. After uploading my photos they blocked my account and could not give me a reason for why it was blocked. Now I'm a ** male 54 years of age but I hold my age well so most people tell me I look to be in my 30s. Anyway I have emailed these people about 5 times asking why is my account blocked and today 8/22/2018 this lady stated that she would need to escalate it up as they had already done that when I created this account back in June of 2018. Yes there are other dating sites out there but this racial profiling needs to stop! therefore I have decided to seek legal action regarding this matter. Let's see how quick Match.com can get this corrected.
