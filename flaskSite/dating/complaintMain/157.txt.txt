I have been on this site for 3 weeks. In that period of time I have had 3 men attempt to scam me, all were fake profiles which I figured out with doing some due diligence, and 2 men wanted only kinky sex. What is wrong with you people. I reported all the issues to Match, but doubt they did anything. They won't tell you. Beware if you are thinking of going on Match. You may have better luck at the bar, at least you can see their real face and turn and run!
