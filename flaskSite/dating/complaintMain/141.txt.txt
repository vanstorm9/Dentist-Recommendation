I signed up for Match based on their advertisement. I opted into a six month deal for the savings. Within a day I knew I had made a mistake, the site works terribly. I decided to cancel the purchase after seeing how awful the website is and the unlikely hood of having a match. For example, I was receiving messages from people who did not in anyway match my profile. I called to cancel. The person I spoke with told me that there is no refund, but they could stop future charges and refused to give my money back. I was very upset, because I had bought the 6 month plan and on day one hated it. I explained, "You are supposed to have x number of days free for trial anyway."
