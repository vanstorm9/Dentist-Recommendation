As others have noted, there seem to be a lot of scammers! Not only that, Match.com must not own a computer with algorithms, because even when you complete every option as to what you’re looking for, it’s totally ignored. For example, I checked that I want agnostics, they matched me with a PASTOR! I said I wanted matches within 100 miles of my home, and they’re sending me people from other states, none of which are within 100 miles. Also, even though I am a woman seeking a man, they occasionally match me with other women. I guess they are afraid if you don’t get enough matches, you’ll be disappointed, but I’d rather get none than a bunch that I wouldn’t even consider. Very frustrating! And, lastly, when you see something in your “inbox”, it’s actually your outgoing likes, smiles, or whatever.
