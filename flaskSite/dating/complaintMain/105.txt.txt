Even Billy the Kid had the courtesy to wear a mask when he robbed people. Match.com does it barefaced and with a misleading service platform. This is a class action suit waiting to happen for any attorney who wants to take a stab at it. I could go into elaborate detail about the devious methods Match.com uses to lure people into paying more money for features, the out of date, abandoned accounts...in fact, EVERYTHING POSTED on this site prior to my review but why repeat it all. Everything you've read on Consumer Affairs is all fairly accurate. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. You're better off finding a date somewhere else...anywhere else, for that matter. Match.com should be shut down by the Federal Trade Commission.
