I have not gone on one date from this site. It’s a rip off. They show you people you cross paths with. There is no way in hell you will ever meet that person. The commercial is a lie. I would cancel if I could get a refund. They send you a profile that someone is interested in you then when you go there the profile is not there. How do they get away with this scam?
