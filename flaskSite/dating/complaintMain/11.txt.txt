Match.com is SCAM! I have registered and paid with my credit card. I got access to use the dating site and after 3 days my account was blocked without any information why. I have sent 4 messages to customer service to explain and to deblock my account but I never got an answer. I registered again with another user name, paid again, and again. After a few days my account was blocked without any reason. Match.com is one big scam, never register on there as it's wasting your money and time.
