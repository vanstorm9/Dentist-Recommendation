Match.com is a joke. You do not have to actually “match” with people before you talk to them, so anyone can talk to you whether they are within your preference parameters or not. I am 19 years old, and 40-60 year old men were sending me flirty messages. I was so disgusted and disappointed and appalled by the fact that I could not control who saw my profile. Also, every single normal 19-22 year old guy that I tried to message, did not respond. I may not be the best at pick up lines and introductions, but I messaged around... oh I don’t know... 20 GUYS!!! And no one responded.
