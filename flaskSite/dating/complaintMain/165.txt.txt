Dear potential customer, this site has been a disaster from the moment I googled it. There has not been one thing that has gone right. I was told I was being given a seven (7) day free trial but after a couple of hours, I was blocked and told to contact customer service. This experience has been one disaster after another and a total waste of time. When I contacted customer service they said the trial doesn't work anymore (after a few hours) and that the only way I could use the site was to pay. I could no longer (after a few hours) check it out to see if I like it. I keep being told that I can log in but I cannot. As the rather lengthy form does take time to complete and ends up being useless, it is counterproductive to bother completing it.
