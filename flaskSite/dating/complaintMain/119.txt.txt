I signed on with Match a little over a month ago. I think that my profile was professional and with enough detail but not overly long. I view myself as fairly attractive for my age. I'm 63. I would send a message to a man that I found interesting. Very little if any response. Men my age or even older want all these women 20-30 years younger. I find that a little disturbing. I cancelled my auto renewal and received an email that they would keep my profile for 1 year after my membership ends. Well now I definitely wonder (and probably know the answer) as to how many profiles are active and legit.
