First off I know I’m a unicorn in the dating world. I’m in shape, attractive, confident, make great money, travel the world, super fun, and extremely intelligent, (Ivy league education). So I go on the site, put together a solid profile, great photos, nothing too risky, to display myself for all to see. Well to my demise all I was getting was extremely unattractive women that were huge by any standards, scammers, extremely old women, (60 plus years old), women that basically wanted more kids and were pushing 40 plus years old, agnostic women, and out of three dates in three months it was a total disaster. All three women had MAJOR medical issues, ranging from deep depression, various stages of debilitating health issues, etc.
