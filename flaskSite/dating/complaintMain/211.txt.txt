At first, I went to Match.com out of curiosity filled in my email address and username but did not complete my profile. From then on, Match.com kept sending matches that cannot be viewed unless the subscription fee is paid. I paid my subscription fee for 3 months only to find out that the quality of match I was getting was not the ones that match my preference. I called Match.com if I could cancel my subscription but was told that it was not refundable. As I was about to log off, 3 matches suddenly appeared and seemed very interested in me. One was very persistent and said that he was new in Match.com and that his subscription was ending so he wanted to give me his email and phone number. I sent him a test mail with no message in it.
