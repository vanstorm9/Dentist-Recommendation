I joined Match.com, I took the leap to pay for the membership. The company automatically charged me at 6 months even though I had deactivated my account. I tried to find a way to contact them and much to my dismay there was only a mailing address, no phone contact. So I contacted PayPal to explain, they refused to give me my money back. That said I was still enrolled in the sites membership and the purchase was authorized. The way to actually deactivate and cancel your membership is so buried in the website it’s almost invisible. I wouldn’t recommend Match.com to my worst enemy! I wouldn’t even recommend PayPal at this point!
