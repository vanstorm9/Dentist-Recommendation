I tried Match.com for around 1-2 years. In that time I only got 1 message and when me and the girl started talking, she said I could call her and then hung up. Most of the women seem fake or have ulterior motives. This site is a total scam and a ripoff. There have been many class action lawsuits filed on this website and I am in no way surprised. I will be sticking to either the free sites where at least you're not wasting your money, or just date girl. Avoid Match like the plague. They will do you no justice. If you pay for this site, you will realize how screwed up it is. So many copied profiles and women who seem like bots.
